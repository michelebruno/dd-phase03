Children 0-17 are not high risk of covid-19 and are also not spreaders of the virus.  No study has provided clear evidence of this.  As of 6/16/21, there have been 322 deaths involving covid-19 in US for ages 0-17.  Covid-19 does not rank in the Top 10 leading cause of death for children <18.\n2. Cloth masks are not effective against covid-19 virus.  There are numerous studies that prove this.  Only N95 masks are actually proven to protect from the virus.  Further, cloth masks have been studied after use in children and are proven to carry numerous strands of bacteria & germs, that pose more health risk to children than covid-19.  Reference study here: https://townhall.com/tipsheet/scottmorefield/2021/06/15/a-group-of-parents-sent-their-kids-face-masks-to-a-lab-for-analysis-heres-what-they-found-n2591047\n3. Masks should be a parental decision, not the school or government.  Parents should be able to determine the risk/reward across numerous factors including physical, mental, and social factors to determine what is best for their child(ren).  Masks can interfere with social development, especially at a young age, by not allowing children to read & recognize facial expressions as a critical factor in hunan interaction.\nBottom line, while not every may agree on this topic, masks should be optional for children for the upcoming school year.","petitionSlug":"the-kenston-local-school-board-kenston-local-schools-petition-to-make-masks-optional","origin":"nomask","author":"Robert Freshman","extracted":"Parents should be able to determine the risk/reward across numerous factors including physical, mental, and social factors to determine what is best for their child(ren)."},{"word":"parents","comment":"Parents should have the right to choose if they want to mask or unmask their own children","petitionSlug":"alta-loma-school-district-mask-choice-and-equitable-access-to-education-for-children","origin":"nomask","author":"Amy Giebrich","extracted":"Parents should have the right to choose if they want to mask or unmask their own children"},{"word":"parents","comment":"I talked to Dr. Wilm after most left the school board meeting.

Masks should be entirely personal/parental choice. It is not necessary for the diocese, or government, to mandate masks. While I cannot speak for everyone, I think there are a vast majority of us who pay the tuition and send our children to private schools not only for the incredible opportunities for our children to learn grow in their faith and spirituality, but also for our children to be able to learn and grown in an environment that fosters creativity, individuality, and the ability to think and do for themselves.

We need someone who is going to stand up for the children & teachers in our county & not turn a blind eye to what is really happening. What is happening is that children are being exposed to Covid and parents are not being notified and quarantining is not happening. Teachers have no power to enforce anything in the classroom regarding masks. Even if I tell my child’s teacher that I want him to wear a mask she is not allowed to prompt or enforce this.
