However, we ask that the County Manager remove Dr. Comstock from her position as the Public Heath Director, and remove Public Health Order 21-002.  This will save our county the time, and money that will be required in defending an unjustified public health order.  As described in C.R.S, § 25-1-515, we parents, and our children of Jeffco have been aggrieved and affected by a decision of the board of health and its Director.  As described below, Dr. Comstock’s order is:\n 1)  Contrary to constitutional rights or privileges;\n 2)  Unsupported by substantial evidence in view of the entire record as submitted;\n3)  Arbitrary or capricious.\n\nAt no point during the last County Manager meeting, within the text of Public Health Order 21-002, or the August 17 meeting of Jeffco Public Health, did the board or Dr. Comstock present hospitalization data needed to justify the mandatory mask order.  Only case counts were presented.  However, if case counts rise, but hospitalizations and deaths of children do not - the order is arbitrary, and unsupported by substantial evidence. In fact, according to Colorado Covid Dashboard, there are 566 hospitalized people in CO total, with just 1.8% of hospitalizations being those under 19 years old.  Therefore, approximately 10 kids are currently hospitalized in all of Colorado.  While sad, it does not support masking children, or infringing on our parental rights considering there over 74,000 kids under 12 here in Jeffco alone.\n\nJeffco Public Health has performed research on the efficacy of face coverings, but its research is limited regarding the use of masks with 2 year old children.  Dr. Comstock repeatedly states in meetings that there are no studies that show mask use have a negative impact on children’s mental health, or ability to learn.  However, as it has been pointed out to Dr. Comstock, and was acknowledged by the Board of Health during the August 17th meeting, such a study would be unethical, and has not been performed. It would be unethical to place masks on a 2 year old, and no masks on another in order to study and watch for negative impacts to one child.s mental health or learning ability. \n\nIts research documented in https://www.jeffco.us/DocumentCenter/ from 2020 does not substantially suggest mask use of young children is a positive deterrent to contracting or sharing Covid-19.  In fact, the evidence recorded by the County often is contradictory regarding the efficacy of mask use overall.  It does not substantially suggest mask use of young children is a positive deterrent to contracting or sharing Covid-19. The public health board does not include the substantial amount of contradictory evidence into the public record. \n\nAlong the many issues described above, Dr. Comstock has repeatedly belittled, and spoken rudely in responses to concerned parents.  She has lost the public trust, and exhibited disrespectful behavior that is not becoming of a Jeffco County employee.  We seek her removal and cancelation of the mask mandate.  Please protect our rights as parents, and avoid a costly judicial review.","petitionSlug":"jefferson-county-colorado-request-for-the-resignation-of-dr-dawn-comstock","origin":"nomask","author":"Matthew Noll","extracted":"In accordance with Colorado Revised Statues, § 25-1-515, the parents of Jefferson County (Jeffco) have been aggrieved by the latest public health order, and are entitled to judicial review by filing in Jeffco district court a request to reverse or modify the public health order.

It is not a healthy solution that we have ever imposed on every healthy man, woman, and child for any other dangerous, infectious disease. Nor has it been effective. And it takes a toll on children’s mental health, their social skills, and their confidence. Last year, my daughter complained of head aches every day after school. Why is that an acceptable trade off when she only went to school while healthy? Besides, the kids have to take their masks off anyways at lunch, for sports, and can immediately take it off after school when they may be around many other people and friends, so it is pointless to make them suffer the rest of the day.  And I am concerned of what impacts it will have on their physical health long-term as their developing brains need oxygen. The parents who feel this virus is a real danger have the option to choose between wearing a mask or virtual school (which would be far more effective than just wearing a cloth.) But there needs to also be a choice for parents and children who want to give their children the same positive learning environment that all other generations prior to this have enjoyed. If our children are sick, they should stay home. And we should emphasize  proper hygiene. Why is it ok to consider overriding a state law and the governor’s executive order? Even those of us who strongly opposed the mandates last year still had to abide by them. Why is it ok to break the mandate this year?

To say the least, I don't think SASD is taking this virus variant seriously. In a \" community where character counts\" not doing all you can to protect the health & safety of all is wrong. Frankly, if my daughter weren't a senior & didn't need classes you don't offer to online to graduate she would be staying home, especially, after the announcement of this mask optional policy in the height of a surge. I also recall the deadline to sign up for virtual academy was JUNE 18TH, when it couldn't be known how things were going to look now, a week away from the first day of school. To me, that doesn't sound like an administration with a keen understanding of how this virus is unpredictable & the need to be proactive as well as preventative. This draft plan also doesn't include specifics for ventilation mitigation, nor does take into account that Delta does not require \"close contact\" to spread. You notify an entire classroom of families for lice & not a deadly disease. You've made it painfully clear that you did not mandate the mask policy for transportation.  I believe, if given the opportunity, you wouldn't have created that policy. I made my mind up long ago that I would remove bussing from our calculus in returning to in-person learning.
