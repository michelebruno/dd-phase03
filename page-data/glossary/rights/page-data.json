There has been way too much unscrupulous activity since this whole \"corona virus pandemic\" started.  There have been many doctors that have come out and questioned the so called science that the cdc claims they are going by only to be censored for speaking about the facts that they have learned through many years of schooling themselves.  Not to mention Dr. Birx herself,  one of the leaders of the covid19 response admitted on live tv that anyone that died that had covid, no matter what they died of was counted as a covid death.  That statement itself should have woken people up to the reality that something nefarious was going on.  And also the facts were shown that the vast majority of people who were at risk of dying of covid 19 were the elderly and people who already had underlying conditions.  These people were the same people that were at risk of dying from any other illness.  And suddenly there were virtually no flu cases last year, deaths by heart attacks, strokes, cancer and virtually all other deaths were way down.  Could it be that this was because all these deaths were counted as covid deaths?  I think so!
