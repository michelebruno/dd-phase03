Parent/Alum here...When I was in college in the early 90’s, the classroom was a place for robust exchanges of ideas, of respectful, albeit at times heated, discussions. We were there to learn, to educate ourselves and to be educated. As it stands now, my child is not receiving an education, they’re receiving an indoctrination and that is unacceptable and frightening. If a teacher wants to share with the class that “we deserved 9/11,” then that teacher needs to be prepared to discuss their viewpoint, as well of those of the class. Calling a student who disagrees and that, no, we did not “deserve” it, a “white privileged nazi” is NOT a healthy (or frankly, rational) discussion.  Viewpoints and opinions are one thing, ideologies are a very different, very dangerous, other thing. Take Greek life for example. Spend 5 minutes on Twitter, and you will find out how many teachers “feel” about the subject. It’s incredibly disconcerting. Students are targeted, belittled, and judged as being part of a “racist, classist, patriarchal system that must be destroyed.” What is progressive or compassionate about such inflammatory statements? Statements coming from those in leadership, no less. Why is UVA enabling the vitriol? For all the recent talk of “safe spaces,” doesn’t every student have the right to feel safe? Stop indulging the cancel culture festering on campus. Lastly, and most importantly, the Covid protocols in place are, and have been, detrimental (understatement) to the students’ mental and physical well being. What part of isolating a child off campus for 14 days, unable to leave for fresh air or exercise, and only a box of food the wouldn’t meet federal govt standards...a low bar to begin with...appropriate?Yet, that is what you all did, until enough pushback gave you the equally inhumane idea of locking down dorms with threats of expulsion should they disobey orders. To make matters worse, you openly encouraged students to report any (perceived) deviation from the weekly Covid edicts. As if there was no room for error in that grand plan. How many students were falsely reported, I wonder.  What proof did you require to ensure these “reports” weren’t simply targeted harassment? Did you advance your mission of a “community bound by trust, respect, and integrity” or is UVA now a community bound by paranoia and fear? Quite the unintended, at least I hope it was, psyop UVA created. If the goal was to break their spirits in order to achieve full submission, congratulations, it worked. I entrusted my child with you all knowing full well there would be rules and expectations. At NO time did it ever occur to me that they would be subjected to the stripping away of basic human rights, and kindness. The bond of trust, the respect I once had, is now gone. My hope is that it can be rebuilt, but given there was a need for this petition, I’m not particularly optimistic. The saddest part about what students have been subjected to this year, is that my child has the means to “escape.” Others don’t have that luxury. It’s heartbreaking when I think about the worry, helplessness, and anger their parents feel. This is not hyperbole. This is based on real conversations with parents anguished over their once “happy go lucky” child. If teachers/leadership spent half the time and energy they spend on Twitter raging and complaining, and, instead, focused on THE STUDENTS, these young people might regain a sense of hope and trust. Students need help now.  Figure it out UVA. It can be done, and it can be done in a safe, actual data, science driven manner. Until then, UVA is failing our young people. The adults in leadership are failing our young people. We adults owe them the same opportunities we had. Time to recenter on our young people.","petitionSlug":"the-univeristy-of-virginia-administration-uva-students-requesting-the-support-of-alumni-and-parents","origin":"nomask","author":"Es Cole","extracted":"Viewpoints and opinions are one thing, ideologies are a very different, very dangerous, other thing."},{"word":"thing","comment":"Because it is the right thing to do!
