These schools now mandate masking and have proper mitigation practices, but only after hundreds of students fell ill and many more were quarantined.   Why does school leadership take the lives of our children and their staff so lightly?  There are currently better mitigation practices for head lice than there are for covid at CCISD.  Physicians, the CDC, AAP and epidemiologists all agree that masking, proper isolation/quarantine, vaccination and social distancing are ALL necessary in surge areas, which we clearly are.  Children under 12 cannot get the vaccine and our overall vaccination for even older kids is very low.  There are currently no pediatric ICU beds open in this area—where will we send kids who get sick as they will get sick since delta covid is as contagious as chicken pox and has almost 3x higher risk for pediatric hospitalization as compared to earlier strains?  There are federal funds for schools to implement online learning—why is this not happening?  This pandemic is real and worse than last year when students were actually masked and had online options.  If nothing can be done, then CCISD really needs to consider delaying school opening several weeks until this surge improves.  Hospitals is this area are already beyond capacity—the community has every right to blame the school leadership for poor outcomes from school related infections if schools have no real preventive practices in place.
