I feel safe as long as guidelines for temperature taking and hand washing and even social distancing in large groups where they can are observed. Simply keeping them covered when for the past 6 months we haven't used covers at home is unnecessary. Adults in home are vaccinated so our children are safe to resume a normal childhood.

Staying home isn’t an option, and we all want our kids back in school this year - but masked. It isn’t fair to put pressure on kids that want to wear masks but feel peer pressured not to - we all remember what it was like at their ages. Besides, mask wearing works best when everyone is participating. The past year and a half has already shown that masks in schools do work. Please keep our kids and families safe until under 12 can also get the vaccine for families that choose it.
