There’s a reason more businesses and organizations are making it mandatory. There is a reason that masks are required for everyone at Mayo Clinic  even after temperature checks and two sets of questions. We owe it to our essential workers everywhere to protect them. Beyond that, as a transplant recipient, I selfishly want people to understand that hand hygiene, wearing masks, and washing them can really make a difference. I think all of this should be a part of a campaign. I have taught strength and conditioning sessions in a mask, had hundreds if not thousands of conversations, and will still wear a mask in situations when the pandemic passes. Again, combined with adequate hand hygiene in the form of carrying sanitizer with me and washing my hands and masks, I do all the things I can to minimize my own exposure. If we want this thing to have a chance of ending quicker, this is a simple measure to help contribute to keeping our citizens healthy. This especially pertains to  those people that have even weaker immune systems then me, have other complicating factors, or are at greater risk because of time of exposure or lack of resources. \n\nIt’s my opinion that I think it is hard for people to imagine what it is like to be really sick, or how that would feel for another person. I know because I have been so ill that I had no idea I was dying, yet, I woke up to find out that I had the chance to live. I don’t want people to have to experience that to understand that getting very ill is awful. It’s awful on your body, mind, and soul. Not everyone will get sick, but everyone with the disease has the chance to make another person sick. We need to control what we can control and quite honestly, I think we need to listen to the healthcare experts and follow the examples of our incredible healthcare systems in this state.

To begin with, if a school has any form of dress code then it is contradictory to say that a mask mandate could not be enforced. If you can dictate how someone dresses, you can do the same for masks. On the topic of contradictions, is it not a bit odd that the safety of your students and staff members is purportedly your number one priority yet you have not taken this action which would greatly enhance the safety of your students/staff. Additionally, we must not only consider the safety of the students and staff themselves, but also their friends and family who may be immunocompromised or otherwise in a state of heightened vulnerability to the complications that SARS-CoV-2 often produces such as pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism, ischemic stroke, and myocardial infarction just to name a few. Some may attempt to present the argument that “masks make it hard to breathe”...this could not be further from the truth. It may make it FEEL more difficult due to the sensation of something covering their airways, but it is simply that, a sensation. Even with multiple masks on, it has been shown by numerous MDs and RNs that blood oxygen saturation (clinical indicator of the body’s ability to effectively respirate) is not affected whatsoever. \n\nPeople are dying and we are too selfish and concerned with our own comfort to wear a mask that could save the lives of ourselves, our friends, and our families.

I believe that masking will be the best bet to keeping kids learning in the physical schools and in front of teachers in person.  I keep replaying in my mind (former Secretary) Dr. Levine saying, “My mask protects you, and your mask protects me.” It does no good if only some people are masking. The unmasked are like broken links in a chain. If we aren’t all linked (in a socially distant and masked kind of way), we can’t be effective in our mitigation efforts. This virus is equal opportunity.  It looks for weak links in our armor.  Knowing how it enters the body, why on earth would we do anything but mask, knowing that social distancing is not promised.  Science is not political.  It is not biased.  We cannot let our decision making be biased in response to this virus. \n \nAs you know, regardless of whether we are vaccinated, vaccinated people can still contract and/or carry the virus, spreading it to others. I worry about the older kids bringing it home. My younger two kids can’t be vaccinated, and I am of the sincere mindset that requiring masks and doing everything possible to socially distance are actions that will achieve the greatest good for the greatest number of people in the end. In the grand scheme of things, they are small sacrifices.   I am not speaking solely on behalf of my family, and I pray that you won’t either.  Once more, I implore you to please lead, not follow, with science guiding the way.","petitionSlug":"bring-universal-masking-to-k-12-schools-and-child-care-facilities-in-pennsylvania","origin":"promask","author":"Melissa Handlovitch","extracted":"Knowing how it enters the body, why on earth would we do anything but mask, knowing that social distancing is not promised."},{"word":"body","comment":"Parents have made the argument that they have a right to choose what happens to their child’s body. They think their argument is like the right to choose whether a child wears a seatbelt - while it would be society’s loss if the child was permanently injured or killed, it would be that parent’s child who bore the cost most directly. We have laws against this. \n\nHowever, this is not really the argument parents are making even if they don’t know it. The true argument a parent is making in attempting to assert “parents rights” over their child wearing a mask is really that they have a right to put other children at risk. If one’s child is infected,  goes unmasked and infects another child (which, is much more likely than if the infected child wore a mask), the parent’s “right” was to choose that the other child got sick. While it’s true that the other child’s chance of getting sick is reduced if they wear a mask, it is not reduced to 0% chance. It’s reduced maybe by half. The parent absolutely does not have a right to make their child a public threat. This makes a mockery of other important, meaningful rights in the name of an irresponsible, thoughtless and careless desire. This is not the American character and it has nothing to do with freedom or rights - only putting children and their future, our future, at risk over extreme selfishness. \n\nParents - put on your big girl/boy pants. Have your child put on the mask, stop clogging up our pediatric ICUs, and stop putting other children at risk.","petitionSlug":"clear-creek-isd-mandate-masks-in-clear-creek-isd","origin":"promask","author":"Michael Goodman","extracted":"Parents have made the argument that they have a right to choose what happens to their child’s body."},{"word":"body","comment":"Children should be protected from the virus as much as possible in school.
