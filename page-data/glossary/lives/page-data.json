That's a CRAZY consent form to ask for, and I would NEVER subject my children to THAT kind of Physical and Mental ABUSE by his school officials, his own teachers, and school staff, that he is SUPPOSED to be able to trust!!\nBut NONE of this is following any science, they're letting the \"vaccinated\" kids stay in school, even if they're exposed, even though transmission by vaccinated people has been PROVEN at this point, and they should be treated just like any other student.\nThe school districts are BULLYING the parents into signing these forms, or they won't let their kids come to school. And they're fine with it. I was told that if I don't sign the consent form I can expect a LOT MORE of these \"modified quarantines\" with ZERO concern for my son's situation, for our situation, our work situations, none of it!! All of it is very SUDDEN when he's supposed to stay home, and I miss work, and he misses class time,  interaction with his friends, group activities with classmates, & perfectly healthy school time.\nThis WHOLE pandemic 400 people under the age of 18 have died. That is in about 20 months. In comparison 798 people under 18 died of \"unintentional drowning\" in 2019, 12 months. NOT that those lives didn't matter, but it's not an escalated number. Kids are NOT overly sensitive to this, and we should not be treating them as if they are. \nI'm sick of my son's school trying to act like a medical facility, and I would like them to go back to being able to see smiles on faces and talk to their friends. To not be medically tested for ANYTHING at all, ever, by the school - because that's not their job, & i'd like to see ACTUAL school subjects actually taught in school, rather than ideologies.\nWould love to meet some of the other ppl who signed!!
