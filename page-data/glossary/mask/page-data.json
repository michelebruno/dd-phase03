A once straight A fun loving, student she became overly quiet, stayed in her room a lot qnd wasn't able to see her friend bc her parents were afraid. She said people didn't talk to her anymore and she was failing 2 classes. Psychologically the social distancing and mask wearing is doing so much more damage than a flu like virus. Teach our children the basic academics and leave it up to us the parents how we respond to q health scare. If BPSD insists on the guidelines that followed last year I will pull my child from the district and send her to a private school. I will not sit back and watch her becomes depressed and withdrawn again.","petitionSlug":"board-of-directors-for-bethel-park-school-district-mask-by-choice-for-students-of-bethel-park-school-district","origin":"nomask","author":"Tracey Sullivan","extracted":"Psychologically the social distancing and mask wearing is doing so much more damage than a flu like virus."},{"word":"mask","comment":"These kids have been in sports, camps, parties, going to sports, vacations and playing with friends all summer maskless.
