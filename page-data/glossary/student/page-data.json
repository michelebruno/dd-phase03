As a teacher, I need to see their faces, so I can quickly determine if a lesson is going well or if the children look confused.  Teachers need to know if their students are happy or sad, and the mask stops us from seeing those emotions.  Covid19 has over a 99% recovery rate.

If someone is under the care of medical professionals and is advised to not wear a mask, I understand this is a decision between the person (their guardians) and their healthcare provider. Notification of not being able to wear the mask due to health reasons should be provided by a person's healthcare provider. The policy suggestion of allowing a parent, guardian, possibly a student, write a letter to be excused from wearing a mask should not be passed. Verification should come from a healthcare provider, who has the training and credentials to make a recommendation that not only affects their patient, but the people around them. We don't accept a parent's word for it that their child is well enough to participate in sports, for example, but require a medical clearance. During a public health crisis, medical personnel are the appropriate people to verify this. Faculty, staff, students, and those they live with are counting on us to protect one another.","petitionSlug":"residents-of-middletown-nj-middletown-masks","origin":"promask","author":"Colleen beach","extracted":"The policy suggestion of allowing a parent, guardian, possibly a student, write a letter to be excused from wearing a mask should not be passed."},{"word":"student","comment":"Please protect frontline workers like my son who is a Texas A&M student who works at HEB to put himself through school.
