The odds of them dying from COVID that they caught from a student after being vaccinated is exponentially smaller than the same teacher dying in a car crash heading to school. Teachers are not at risk. The risk is being put on the children forced to wear a mask all day that becomes FILLED with germs. Start putting children first.

As a healthcare professional, I put stock in the recommendations for the American Pediatric Academy, and their recommendations that any child over the age of 2 - regardless of vaccination status - should be masked while inside. CISD did not have numerous COVID cases last year because 1) everyone had a mask on and 2) the Wuhan strain is not Delta. On Thursday, the 2nd day of school, I was notified of a positive COVID case within my child's class. 3 of 24 children are masked and the teacher will not remind masked children to wear properly. I have offered to purchase wipes and Lysol spray. That has not been acted upon. If CISD is not putting into place other protective measures (e.g. using misters, wiping and cleaning classrooms, hand sanitizer, air filtration systems) in at least elementary the easiest thing to do is a mask mandate.  As a mother I am wrestling with the virtual program option that seems punitive in substance for those children who may participate. My child has already been to class and if is pulled will be reshuffled in a different class in Jan. I feel that is cruel as well. She should be able to return to the class where she has made a relationship.  Parents trust that the Central Office and Administration will protect our children. A mask is not political, it is protection - plain and simple.  That we have gotten here as a society is heart wrenching.

It's been well-established by medical experts that, with this particular virus, wearing masks is one of the absolute most important and effective things we can do to protect EVERYONE. To knowingly ignore this is negligent and reprehensible. That said, it only works if we ALL (with the exception of those with valid health issues) take responsibility and wear them CONSISTENTLY.  It must be mandated in order to work.\n\nUnfortunately, \"Strongly recommending\" or \"Strongly encouraging\" simply won't suffice. That type of verbiage will not be enough and we all know this. Peer pressure amongst students (\"he's not wearing one, so neither will I\") will quickly cause decreasing numbers of mask-wearers by the day. \n\nWhile I personally do not feel that elementary-age children wearing masks ALL DAY (through 7 hours of instruction, inside their \"family modell\" classroom) is feasible or prudent , I do, however, feel very strongly that in order to strike a compromise while still best protecting our children AND our teachers, bus drivers, and other adult staff (who are indispensable and far more vulnerable), masks should be MANDATORY in FOUR key areas/times: \n 1. Buses 2. Hallways/Common Areas 3. Arrival and 4. Dismissal.  \nMandating masks in these locations and situations makes complete sense given the much larger groups and wider exposure, which is inevitable and very concerning.  \n\nThis is not asking too much of our children. They CAN do this. But they need adults (*parents and *administrators) to set an example. If there's anything we need to TEACH our children, it's that we must care for one another and do what's necessary to get this under control. By mandating masks during key areas and times, we can protect everyone and decrease the spread. \n\nIf other schools and states can do this, SO CAN WE. Sadly, our state has failed miserably to slow the spread of COVID-19.  Our numbers are abysmal and terrifying- among the highest in the WORLD. We have to stand up and do what is right. To do WHAT WORKS to contain the virus. Fort Mill School District's motto is \"Children First...Every Day.\"  Our district needs to DEMONSTRATE this. We MUST protect our children's health and safety, more than anything else. \n\nEnforcing a MASK *RULE will do just that. It will save lives...of both teachers and students (as well as families, friends, and others in our beloved community).
