My husband teaches high school history. He has faithfully taught in person classes for the entire school year. The school has taken many precautions and has had minimal impact from Covid-19.  At the same time I have listened weekly to the podcast, the Osterholm Update, in an effort to understand the public health issues around Covid-19. \nNow that we know more than we did 1 year ago, I think it’s clear that UVA’s restrictions are excessive. Please consider the cost to our students’ mental health and reduce the restrictions. We must find a balance between living safely and LIVING. There are precautions that can be put in place to create a more interactive learning environment. The risk of the spread of Covid-19 is not the only risk to consider, nor is it the most important. I appreciate that these are difficult decisions, but it is imperative to to change the current environment at UVA. \nFinally, it grieves me that these students feel that they must protest anonymously!  If this does not grieve the UVA administration, then you should consider what your purpose is. Please ask yourselves how you have allowed students to become fearful of dialog.","petitionSlug":"the-univeristy-of-virginia-administration-uva-students-requesting-the-support-of-alumni-and-parents","origin":"nomask","author":"Carey Albritton","extracted":"The risk of the spread of Covid-19 is not the only risk to consider, nor is it the most important."},{"word":"spread","comment":"Our kids need NO MASKS!

I’ve read a tremendous amount of data, studies & listened to doctors, virologists, & immunologists on either side of this & while I am nothing more than a lay person on the street, I try to be as logical as I can about this & all matters regarding covid & my own personal well being.  I have grave concerns about the dangers of masks themselves & the harm they can do.  When reading comments & hearing conversations where it’s been said “it’s only a mask; what could it hurt?”  The people who are saying this couldn’t have invested the time to learn all they can about the dangers of masks.  I have spent many hours & days studying information & there is nothing that has been  proven to show that masks are beneficial in reducing the spread of this virus or any sickness.  My only regret is I wish I had saved the CDCs own study about masks that was posted on their website in mid to late summer 2020, but was removed a few days afterwards.  Masks harbor germs & are germ infested once the first breath is taken through one.  I am unable to wear a mask due to personal reasons, but even if I could, I believe I would have to decline doing so for other health reasons.  I suffer from two chronic immune system diseases, so I am not in a position to take that kind of a chance.  Children & their health & well being which includes their mental state are the focus of this petition & I agree the mandatory decision made by some of the school board members is not the best decision.  Parents should be the ones making the decision about their own children.  Parents know their children’s medical conditions & their day to day well being.  I believe the parents that say their children were suffering from wearing masks.   I think the board should reconsider their decision & agree that optional masking should be allowed.","petitionSlug":"bibb-county-unmasked-our-children-movement","origin":"nomask","author":"Teresa Crawford","extracted":"I have spent many hours & days studying information & there is nothing that has been  proven to show that masks are beneficial in reducing the spread of this virus or any sickness."},{"word":"spread","comment":"I believe in parental rights.
