I agree as much as anybody else that we should have local control over mask mandates.\n\nI have three children in the district and I would like nothing more than to be able to tell them that I could fix this. I wish I could.\n\nI would also like to try to correct some misunderstandings in the community. I speak only for myself and do not speak for the board.\n\n#1: The school board has no control over masking decisions at this time. The governor has usurped our local control and has taken it out of our hands. If we had the authority to unmask the children I have no doubt that is the action we would take. We passed a unanimous resolution and sent a letter to the governor requesting local authority regarding masks and our desire to let our kids go back to school unmasked.\n\nIt may seem like the school board can do something about this situation, but we simply can't. Our hands our tied. But, we stand together with all of those that want to unmask our children.\n\nA better target is the governor. A petition to the governor, letters to the governor, and protests against the governor's decisions would be more appropriate.\n\nYou don't need to convince the school board, we already agree with you.\n\n#2: There's a belief by some people that we school board members serve on this board as our job and that we are willingly in cahoots with the governor because we want to protect the money that we receive personally for serving on the board. The fact is that we all receive $400 per month for our time. This is far from a job, it's community service. Every member of the board has another full-time job or is retired after a full career. The talk regarding money is actually that 99% of our funding comes from the state government. The state has threatened to withhold our funding if the mask mandate is not enforced. What this means is that the 900+ employees of the district, your neighbors and friends, would not be getting a paycheck, the schools would be closed and little kids would be stuck with nowhere to go during the day while their parents go to work.\n\n#3 There's a belief by some that the superintendent, Keith Lewis, could change these rules. It's even been suggested that if he doesn't \"stand up to the governor\" that he should resign. This is nonsense. Mr. Lewis has been nothing but proactive and a leader in the behinds-the-scenes interactions between local (especially rural) districts and the governor. He is also on your side.","petitionSlug":"douglas-county-unmask-douglas-county-kids","origin":"nomask","author":"Robbe Lehmann","extracted":"#2: There's a belief by some people that we school board members serve on this board as our job and that we are willingly in cahoots with the governor because we want to protect the money that we receive personally for serving on the board."},{"word":"people","comment":"I’m signing this because children should not be forced to wear masks!!

It is also against our God given rights to force human beings of America, the land of the free, to wear something covering our face at which does not even protect us against the virus.

We get it and beat it or it kills us which is a lot less likely. What’s more important for “beating” this “pandemic” is over coming the obesity epidemic we face these days. We must focus on over all mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual health at which increases our immunity and leads to two situations. A. Never getting Covid or B. Getting it and becoming immune to it. That’s all. Instead of turning one another against each other, we should allow people to live their lives and choose how they want to go about it.

It is not the school district’s job or place to decide what is right for our children. Our children should not have a choice taken away from them of whether or not they will wear a mask, they should not be forced but given the option by parents who know and love their children far better than any school board. We should have rights to decide if we choose not to mask our children. Covid-19 is here, we can’t think it will magically disappear if we all wear masks. By instating lock downs, other restrictions, forcing people to wear masks against their own will, we are causing hurt and harm to those who did nothing wrong. This is a fight against having freedom to do what we feel is in the best interest for our health and our families health. The restrictions are destroying our economy, our countries small businesses, leading to a spike in suicide and a decrease in mental health. We are creating a far bigger plague that is effecting more than just those with COVID-19. Everyone has been in one way or another affected and we are creating new problems, and we are doing far greater harm than good. A mask restriction may seem a small thing but it is a sign of our freedoms being taken from us- a government telling us that we can’t make good decisions for ourselves and our families. This country stands for freedom, freedom to make a choice of what we feel is right. There is no “right” or “wrong” here. If we keep placing such hard restrictions we hurt the innocent, destroy business, and are fueling pain and mental illness, and may continue to loose innocent people to suicide. People will continue to loose their jobs, their homes, their livelihoods and the economy will continue to spiral and the federal government will go into perpetual debt. If we lift restrictions there is a chance we may loose more lives to COVID-19, however those who are high risk can choose to protect themselves, take extra precautions, and choose to be vaccinated. That’s really what it comes down to is choice. We should be given the choice to own up to our personal decisions of what we feel to be right and not allow the government, school boards, or anyone to take those choices away from us and then we must individually and collectively own up to the consequences (knowing there will be consequences regardless of the choice) and do our very best to gain control of the situation.
