Clearly at least 4 of you are ignorant to the impacts on a person's lungs from wearing a mask.\n\nGod created the mouth and lungs to perform a function that isn't up for debate. Your recent decision to force masks back on the faces of children is as ignorant and weak minded as it was last year. \n\nI encourage parents to encourage children to throw them away, to resist the tyranny of your decision. I pray that every child everywhere will unite on school grounds, take hands, hug and sit in unity to show you that you have no right to control their bodies. Many of the children have no one to fight for them and because of powers like yours must learn early to stand for themselves.\n\nYour mask order is detrimental to every child who is forced to abide by it. \nThe exhaled product from lungs is toxic and meant to be released into the air to be filtered by nature. Your requirement forces every lung in every child to inhale the toxins back into their lungs. As educated people, I would expect you to understand at least that basic fact. \nTo explain further, your requirement is causing a toxic buildup of CO2 in every child's lungs. \nCO2 is heavy and sits in the lungs after a person exhales in a normal way. Over a period of time, undetermined by doctors, the CO2 causes life threatening issues. However, it's been proven that there are immediate ill effects such as a lightheaded feeling or feeling faint, overheating, confusion, coughing(which is the body's way of trying to expel the toxins), nausea and vomiting....over a period of time the lungs will cross a line that they cannot recover from.\nYour requirement goes against God's intentions. \n\nIf you choose to continue on this path of ignorance and abide by the fear put upon you by Roy Cooper's insistence that you force toxins into every child's lungs by demanding they cover their face, I assure you that resistance will grow. Only God knows how far the parents, guardians and even the children will go to put a stop to your tyranny. I stand with them.\n\nAs you may or may not know, Rowan County has made the news several times. For the most part, our citizens have refrained from going along with the current administration's requirements recommended by those who support the New World Order. One news reporter spoke of us as though we are simple rural folk who need to be educated and encouraged to conform. \n\nA lot of our citizens have chosen not to participate in the current drug trials and Roy Cooper seems to have a problem with that decision. \nOn behalf of myself and my simple rural folk friends, you can tell Roy Cooper to go to hell.\nInterested to know how many children I have in your school system? Well I'll tell you like God tells me,  they're all mine. \n\nSincerely \nCrystal R Lineberry","petitionSlug":"make-mask-optional-for-rowan-salisbury-schools","origin":"nomask","author":"Crystal Lineberry","extracted":"Your recent decision to force masks back on the faces of children is as ignorant and weak minded as it was last year.

A simple way to protect unvaccinated kids from the delta variant shouldn’t be controversial. Knowingly allowing conditions that increase the spread of the virus might be enough to overcome municipal immunity if a child dies. Why would anyone want to create that potential liability to placate those misinformed people who have turned their back on the very concept of a community?  Being loud doesn’t make you a majority.  There are far more of us out here doing the right thing and taking the steps needed to protect our friends and neighbors from this pandemic of the unvaccinated.  The administration showed courage in imposing the mask mandate because it was so obviously the right thing to do despite the completely predictable response from certain people.

I shouldn't have to choose between my child's best health and his best education. Masks are recommended by the CDC and mandated by Fort Mill. To exclude a mask mandate from the in-person school option is to jeopardize the health and wellbeing of students, teachers, staff, family members, and the community at large. #Childrenfirst should put children's (and teachers') health first, education second, and politics a distant last. The debacle over the misleading teacher survey statistics was inexcusable. How can you put forth a plan that jeopardizes teachers' health, without their input, and without the support of over half of teachers? It's time to poll parents and teachers again, given the recent spike in SC COVID numbers and ask about how comfortable people feel without the protection of masks. I'm confident you would see drastically lower numbers now. This shouldn't be a political decision. The school board should draft an in-person plan that provides the least risk to keep the most amount of people healthy. And to do so would require you to follow CDC and Fort Mill in the mask requirements. \n\nSide note: I understand that you need to hire teachers for the Virtual Academy now, but asking parents to decide a month before school starts (and let's be real, a lot can change in month of COVID) is problematic, especially since you are making parents choose for the whole year.
