If they'd had to wait for Travis County, they would still be waiting. Capacity limits do cause some harm to business owners, but masks are the most minor inconvenience, and they save lives. They also help the economy--more people feel comfortable shopping that way.

My child is 11 yrs old & agenda a middle school where 75% of kids DO NOT wear masks!  She is not yet old enough to receive her vaccination. So she does everything she can to protect herself and her peers Pierce. Unfortunately the same as not being done for her. All variants of this virus are primarily spread through the air.   If a child who does not wear a mask Hazarvis, comma they go around spreading it around spreading it to everyone they come in contact with. Then, the kids/staff they infected do the same. It's a never ending cycle that can at least be better controlled with protection measures in place!  This is not about anyone's rights to wear or not wear a mask. What it is about is protecting one another from this horrible virus.  If you don't wanna wear a mask when you're at home that's fine it's fine but when you are around others who have to interact with you when you go in public such as school, the grocery store, government buildings and medical offices additional safety precautions need to be taken! This shouldn't even be a discussion!\n\nFurthermore, the UCPS BOE does NOT have the tools to teach the children who have been quarantined.  Remote learning consist of being being able to call all and leave messages for their teachers until 4:00 p.m. if they have questions & are told to consult the programs such as CampusED if they need further help. Otherwise, check the calendar and your email for assignments.  How this is not directly leaving a child behind I don't know!!  Is anyone really truly OK with these kids not learning anything anything while they are out and being left behind when it could be completely different?\n\nColleges have instructor led classes online students can attend by using a webcam. UCPS students could be learning the EXACT same way. Why are the teachers not being allowed to continue to teach as they normally would to their class of that are or as well? If they are in school and only a small number of students were quarantined, why can't a webcam be setup and focused on the teacher as he teaches the students physically in school while the quarantined students follow along from home? Same schedule, etc?\n\nThe UCPS BOE could have had this implemented before school started. It would only take a video messaging program coded for businesses, an internet connection and the Lenovo chromebooks that our students were assigned at the beginning of school.  That's literally it! Teachers could even assist the quarantined students one on one.  Granted it would not be perfect but it would absolutely be better than this! \n\nBetween the parents demanding their children have the RIGHT to wear or not wear a mask being unconcerned with the fact students and staff are being infected with this virus, half of the adults - parents, teachers and UCPS BOE - twiddling their thumbs as quarantined children are at home being left behind, not getting any education at all..... I have become literally disgusted with the so called community we live in. It's extremely disappointing. \n\n It's not only keeping the quarantine children from learning but it's also stopping the children currently in school from learning. Has anyone noticed the homework situation?  How there isn't any? At least that is the situation in middle school. There should have been homework last week, imo.  Children need homework to retain the information they ARE learning and while it hasn't been said specifically the issue is due to 5K children currently quarantined, I'm betting that's exactly what's happening. \n\nRather than sit here and wait for my child to be sent home for quarantine for to possible infection from other students, unprotected and constantly closely around her, I choose to fight this problem now.  I will fight  For her right to feel safe and BE SAFE while at school.  I will also fight to remove UCPS BOE as the responsible party for knowing and deciding what is best for all of our children, without ONCE consulting the parents of said children.  They clearly do not know what they're doing based on the number of children currently quarantined and their complete failure at establishing a successful method for quarantined children to learn! Every parent should be on the same page as myself at this point, unless they feel it's acceptable for the children to not recieve an education altogether. Every board member, aside for the one individual who finally went against the grain, should be removed from their position and that includes Houlihan.","petitionSlug":"roy-cooper-masks-for-all-in-school-897312d3-7987-4494-baff-95f49fe04fe3","origin":"promask","author":"Jess Stewart","extracted":"If you don't wanna wear a mask when you're at home that's fine it's fine but when you are around others who have to interact with you when you go in public such as school, the grocery store, government buildings and medical offices additional safety precautions need to be taken!"},{"word":"government","comment":"No signing this crap!!!

It doesn't make sense to force people to wear masks, when the only masks that work, and only work when properly fitted, are the N95 masks which are for heath care workers only. It doesn't help keep my immunity strong to wear a mask and actually weakens it. When I don't wear one, the only one at risk is me ( that is, if you truly believe they work to begin with). I should always have the right to chose what is on my body or in my body and no one else. The idea of the mask mandate is to see who is submissive enough to lose their freedom and I'm not.\nWhen we do the mask mandate we will be falling victim to the lies and deceit that has already been perpetrated on the American people by the media and the left agenda. Right now, the truth is coming out. Lies are being made know and secrets are being brought to light, just be patient. I'm pretty sure we are about to learn that all the numbers of death, except a very small percentage, were lies manipulated to get the financial pay out promised by the leftist government program. We can't and shouldn't live in fear, we must look to God and live. We need to get our economy back up and going and those at risk or who are elderly have the right to take precautions and keep themselves safe. The rest of us need to get back to work. This is a weak virus and isn't any worse than the common flu and has not caused the effect we have seen nation wide.
