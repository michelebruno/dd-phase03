If you want the freedom to not have a mask stripped off of your face, you must respect everyone else's freedom to not force a mask onto theirs. This is the basic golden rule everyone should have learned by now. I have a very weak immune system and am at great risk for dying from coronavirus but, I have taken every precaution I can, and remained mindful of ways I can avoid contracting it, and I have forged a path that I have been able to, so far, NOT contract the disease as my test showed.
