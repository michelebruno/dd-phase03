We are now all healthy and have begun the vaccine. If masks are mandatory we become a police environment, provoking tempers and hostilities.  Half of the people don't wear their masks correctly, nose exposed, half on half off because they are ill fitting or uncomfortable for so many reasons, mist masks are not N95 rather generic from China made of random materials and people don't adhere to a regular cleaning schedule. They were the same one for weeks.. How healthy can that behold? Who is going to monitor all of this? We should not be put in this position.  Have a pro mask campaign, let businesses support wearing masks & let it go. We have enough draconian mandates coming our way with this new administration. I was threatened by another customer recently in  TJ Maxx for not walking the right according to the outdated arrows on the floor. I went directly to the management as the arrows should have been removed and now have been. Is this what we want to reduce ourselves to, an angry mob? Take positive measures over draconian. Do we really want to promote ill fitting dirty face masks of unknown origin? I'm appalled what I see on hanging off of people's faces. Mandates promotes judgment, anger, rules and control.

There is ZERO proof of mask efficacy (in fact, to the contrary-several significant sources if peer-reviewed studies show the dangers!) in anyone when utilizing cloth or surgical masks. Did you know that specific architecture and engineering is required within health and medical facilities that enable health care workers and patients to wear certain masks safely and effectively? Are our schools ventilation systems regulated and engineered in this way? I’ll answer that: NO, they absolutely are not. It is dangerous and hazardous to the health of anyone wearing these types of masks for extended periods of time within settings other than those designed for mask use in this manner. Furthermore, it does nothing to stop viruses from moving through the air. Now, stop the political charade snd stop the attempts to force masks on our children! The MDHHS also has ZERO authority to “mandate” or create ANY type of requirements by LAW. Legislature never approved any of this. Hence it is null and void as far as enforcement. Their job is solely to provide health assistance to the community, nothing more. \nDirectly from Michigan legislature: \nTHE REVISED SCHOOL CODE (EXCERPT)\nAct 451 of 1976\n\n\n380.1307b Statement of prohibited practices.\nSec. 1307b.\n\nThe state policy under section 1307a shall include a clear statement that all of the following practices are prohibited for school personnel in the public schools of this state under all circumstances, including emergency situations:\n(a) Corporal punishment, as defined in section 1312.\n(b) The deprivation of basic needs.\n(c) Child abuse.\n(d) Seclusion, other than emergency seclusion.\n(e) The intentional application of any noxious substance or stimulus that results in physical pain or extreme discomfort.
