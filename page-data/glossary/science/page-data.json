There are studies that prove they do more harm than good, one just recently showed all the pathogens that are on these masks after just a few hours of wear. Children have a 99.997% chance of surviving this virus WITHOUT ANY TREATMENT and masks do not prevent the spread of the virus. Per the recent Stanford study published at NIH.gov, \"According to the current knowledge, the virus SARS-CoV-2 has a diameter of 60 nm to 140 nm [nanometers (billionth of a meter)] [16], [17], while medical and non-medical facemasks’ thread diameter ranges from 55 µm to 440 µm [micrometers (one millionth of a meter), which is more than 1000 times larger [25]. Due to the difference in sizes between SARS-CoV-2 diameter and facemasks thread diameter (the virus is 1000 times smaller), SARS-CoV-2 can easily pass through any facemask.\" Those that want to wear one should be able to but I want my children UNMASKED 8/16!","petitionSlug":"isbe-d211-d15-and-d54-make-masks-vax-optional-no-contact-trace-or-quarantine-d211-and-d54","origin":"nomask","author":"Jennifer Dahl","extracted":"The true science does not support children being masked."},{"word":"science","comment":"School aged children should not be required to wear a mask.
