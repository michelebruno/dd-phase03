The virus alone for the unvaccinated has a greater than 99.9% chance of survival for most 60 and under and I’ve seen studies with ages higher than that. All of this is absolutely ludicrous.

With that said, children are dirty and touching everything including their mask “that doesn’t prevent this virus”.   They don’t have the proper training and maturity level to not touch the mask.   Also studies show there are more harm on are children wearing masks.  They are developing Respiratory issues due to wearing masks.    Bottom line….   Nobody is trained to wear proper masks or training in proper sterile techniques to properly wear a mask that doesn’t protect them or others from this virus.  \n\nOnly an N95 mask that is properly tested and fitted to a person will protect them from any virus and can only be worn once for a few hours.","petitionSlug":"lacey-twp-superintendent-dr-vanessa-clark-make-masks-optional-for-lacey-twp-students","origin":"nomask","author":"Jodi Swire","extracted":"Nobody is trained to wear proper masks or training in proper sterile techniques to properly wear a mask that doesn’t protect them or others from this virus."},{"word":"others","comment":"There are 2 sides to this issue.

Forcing an experimental vaccine on an RN- that if refused will result in job loss is at the very least coercion.  It’s violates the Nurses Pledge, as well as the Nuremberg code.  Nurses are NOT study subjects,!  However, if they were study subjects then the vaccine trial (because let’s face it- that is what it is) would be wholly voluntary and without consequences if refused.  Since there is ZERO longitudinal data on safety, efficacy, long term side effects, etc., it is absolutely egregious that any RN or front line health provider should be coerced into having it injected into their body.  This also makes it IMPOSSIBLE for the recipient to be able to make an informed decision because there is woefully insufficient data.  Scientists do not even know when a booster is due, or how many.  The playbook is being written on the fly- THIS IS NOT SCIENCE!  So far the recommendation is now 3 vaccines in the span in one year-none of them prevent variants, nor do they prevent the vaccinated from carrying and spreading the virus to others.  So how exactly will vaccinating RNs protect patients?  It WON’T.  Providing accessible and quality PPE will, as it has been doing.   RNs are entitled to the right to self determination.  Imagine a world where RNs refused the vaccine and they were all terminated from their positions.  Whose taking care of patients?

Cancer patients on chemo have always worn masks in public - they didn't require it of the rest of humanity. It's inhumane to force students to cover their faces, to wear bacteria-ridden masks all day long, to continuously breathe their own carbon dioxide back in.

As an AP / Honor student who is at higher risk of COVID-19. I'm disappointed to hear that I would be having to put my health at risk to get an education. I am a student who suffers from asthma and other pre-existing health conditions. Having myself to be going to school while covid-19 has taken a total of 941 confirmed cases and 17 deaths in Wilson County with numbers increasing will be putting my health, my family's health, the students’ health, the teachers’ health, the staff’s health, and overall everyone's health at risk. By making me have to go to school to get a college credit that I am planning on working hard to earn lacks consideration to people like me, vulnerable to getting COVID-19. The CDC ( Centers for Disease Control ) informed, “Everyone is at risk for getting COVID-19 if they are exposed to the virus. Some people are more likely than others to become severely ill, which means that they may require hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help them breathe, or they may even die.”  This is an extremely bad thing especially for a nation that lacks free healthcare for all. This being said, having AP/Honor students to be going to school to get college credit that they work incredibly hard for may cause catastrophic harm for the students and the people around them. Everyone can be affected if exposed, and I'm one that is not willing to take that risk. I know there are guidelines to stay safe such as washing hands and staying 6 ft apart, but in a school like Watertown High School, that might just be nearly impossible to stay 6 feet apart. The hallways, classrooms, and cafeteria are all easy ways to transfer covid-19, not to mention bathrooms. I don't know about you, but I have seen countless people go to the bathroom and not wash their hands. Having people with underlying medical conditions to go to school is discrimination against people who have immune systems that they cannot control. This is ableist, and shows how far your empathy extends. These are human lives at risk. Kids. The United States of America currently has 2,886,267 confirmed cases and 129,811 total deaths, and these cases keep growing especially with the economy opening back up. I hope we can find another solution to this problem because we as a whole are not doing enough.\n\nMandy Jones","petitionSlug":"donna-wright-make-wilson-county-schools-mandate-face-masks-for-7-12-graders","origin":"promask","author":"mandy jones","extracted":"Some people are more likely than others to become severely ill, which means that they may require hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help them breathe, or they may even die.”  This is an extremely bad thing especially for a nation that lacks free healthcare for all."},{"word":"others","comment":"The lives of others outweigh anyone's mild discomfort","petitionSlug":"porter-county-we-need-a-mask-mandate","origin":"promask","author":"Alexis Jagier","extracted":"The lives of others outweigh anyone's mild discomfort"},{"word":"others","comment":"It's important to wear a mask to help protect ourselves and others.","petitionSlug":"fcboe-set-a-mask-requirement-at-fayette-county-schools","origin":"promask","author":"Mary Lou Sicard","extracted":"It's important to wear a mask to help protect ourselves and others."},{"word":"others","comment":"I care about others.","petitionSlug":"milwaukee-should-require-masks-in-public-places-to-protect-residents","origin":"promask","author":"Jill Taylor","extracted":"I care about others."},{"word":"others","comment":"My son is 6 and unable to get the vaccine.
