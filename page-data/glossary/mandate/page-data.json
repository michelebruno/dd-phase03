The virus still has a 99.8% chance of survival, and that .2% is only the elderly and weakened immune system that were sadly going to pass on anyways from other causes.  Nobody actually dies FROM covid, they just happen to die from other causes but the hospitals will mark it as a covid death so that they get their medicare or medicaid money, which so happens to be around $350,000 per case death.

And, school districts and school boards will make decisions for the schools within their districts.”  Yet, on August 4th, randomly and without any relevant evidence based data, Governor Pritzker reversed course and announced a mere 17 days later (curiously, only days after nearly half a million unmasked young people attended Lollapolooza along with Governor Pritzker & Mayor Lighfoot)  that “far too few school districts have chosen to follow the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention prescription for keeping students and staff safe.” This leads me to a few questions. When will this mandate be revoked? What metrics will Illinois need to reach to reverse course? Is this mandate truly lawful? It is lawful if we are in a state of emergency.
