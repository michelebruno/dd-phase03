This should be a choice made by each individual or family, not something forced on our children. The few private schools just in our community have proven schools can function normally and healthily without wearing masks, which have been shown to do no good anyway. Kids deserve to see each other and their teachers laugh and smile. And for the love of God they deserve to breathe fresh air. Teachers deserve to be able to concentrate on teaching rather than worry about who may have pulled their mask below their nose to take A BREATHE OF FRESH AIR. For those of you that do believe in wearing a mask and getting the vaccine, carry on. Those of us that feel differently shouldn’t be a threat if you believe those doing things serve their purpose.","petitionSlug":"stanly-county-board-of-education-unmask-stanly-county-schools","origin":"nomask","author":"Janna Brown","extracted":"The few private schools just in our community have proven schools can function normally and healthily without wearing masks, which have been shown to do no good anyway."},{"word":"community","comment":"Everyone please understand that the school board will have a plan in place by 8/1.

The recommendation that all students and teachers K-8 should still wear masks regardless of vaccination status, sets a dangerous precedent. Local districts need to stand against this recommendation because enforcing masks on children due to vaccination status will ultimately require all public school students to get the vaccine. I can promise you that many of my students and parents will not support the bullied vaccination of their children. That’s the dangerous precedent/path we have before us. We can not allow this to happen. I saw first hand how the masks effected the students socially and emotionally throughout the entire school year. Being back in the classroom versus online was much more beneficial for students academically. We never had major issues with covid and cases were minimal. I believe this was not because of the masks but because of what the science says about children and this virus. In spite of the science when we had a case, students STILL had to quarantine who were in close contact. This effected student learning to a large degree, but that’s an issue for another day. I chose to get the vaccine because I thought it would help our chances of not wearing masks next school year and I wanted to protect my pregnant wife and then newborn son. We have to start thinking logically on this, not politically, and not out fear. The science states that children experience lower infection rate, are less likely to transmit the virus, and are not primary drivers of community transmission. The science also states that children are 43% as susceptible to Covid-19 and they transmit the virus 63% of an adults transmission rate.(https://www.healthline.com/health-news/kids-are-half-as-likely-get-covid-19-as-adults-heres-what-we-know#Why-are-kids-less-susceptible-to-COVID-19? ) Not to mention nearly 50% of NC’s population is fully vaccinated. With all of this combined and the vaccination of adults in the school system. There is NO need to wear the masks this school year. This path will lead to a decrease in public education attendance. It will also lead to parents and communities losing faith and trust in the public education system. I hope my story will resonate with others. I do not post my political opinions for everyone to see, but I felt that someone in the system needed to speak out about this issue. Help spread the word and speak out about this issue. Nothing will change if we don’t let our voices be heard.","petitionSlug":"roy-cooper-unmask-our-children-at-school","origin":"nomask","author":"Levi Blalock","extracted":"The science states that children experience lower infection rate, are less likely to transmit the virus, and are not primary drivers of community transmission."},{"word":"community","comment":"Those who want to mask up, mask up.
