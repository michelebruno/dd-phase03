He did the same in preschool. My second grader wears his after a year of virtual school. Yet, as one of only two who mask in his KG classroom, my younger son got sick in two weeks. That doesn’t prove masks don't work; it shows that masks work BEST when *everyone* is wearing them to contain their own germs. Look at what RSV is doing to kids and the healthcare system. It shows the power that masks had on protecting kids from A LOT of illnesses last year. It also reveals the consequences of lifting the mandates. My son’s illness is fairly mild because of his mask. His mask did more to protect the others in his class from the cold he’s been incubating and would have been spreading, while he almost certainly picked up this virus (thank God not COVID) from someone who was sick and unmasked at school. HE missed a day of class and I missed a day of work to get him rested & tested & checked & cleared because we care about the classroom being safe for everyone. Mandate masks *now* before we reach the case thresholds so more kids can avoid the fear we had to endure AND stay in-person full-time. No it’s not ideal, but community is built from shared sacrifice and goals. Let’s teach our kids that protecting each other is worth a little inconvenience. Kids will thrive and adapt. They’ll follow if we lead. And if in-person is the priority, mandate masks to PREVENT an outbreak, not after one is already rampaging.","petitionSlug":"cg-superintendint-and-cg-school-board-keep-our-center-grove-students-safe-start-with-a-mask-mandate","origin":"promask","author":"Katie Sickmeier","extracted":"His mask did more to protect the others in his class from the cold he’s been incubating and would have been spreading, while he almost certainly picked up this virus (thank God not COVID) from someone who was sick and unmasked at school."},{"word":"covid","comment":"I’m signing because vaccines are wearing off, covid is spreading, kids under 12 cannot even get vaccinated, and even pediatricians are very concerned about the delta variant in kids.

Ignoring the scientific facts on the dangers of SARS Co-V 2 mutations, that are occurring from unchecked transmission, in unvaccinated people, and the efficacy of masks to curb this spread, is simply ignorant. Children in other states attending school in-person are becoming ill, filling pediatric wards all over the country. These mutations are making our children and everyone else, more vulnerable to illness, and possible devastating covid long-term effects. This is a real life experiment, we must all pay attention to. Children do not live in a bubble. Our community is full of people at risk of severe illness and death, even when vaccinated, including: cancer patients, those with autoimmune diseases, primary immune diseases, transplant patients, and people over 65 whose immune systems are compromised by age. Parents against masks are teaching their children to be narcissists, instead of caring, community members.

COVID-19 mask mandates are meant to control and divide us, and the plan is working quite well. Reading through the comments, It seems obvious that those who support this petition have only ever been an employee and never owned a retail type business. It would be an insidious, deplorable act for any government agency to FORCE their local businesses to be the \"mask police\"... Escort people out? Spend money hiring \"security guards\" to keep the non-conformists away?? WHAT? Its like the movies Red Dawn and Idiocracy mixed together -- the Russians and the Cubans have taken over America, and they rely on the weak to snitch out those who don’t fall in line. My issues with masks are as follows: 1) Masks don’t work, it even says so on the box. Walmart requires masks nationwide? Good! THEY’RE ON AISLE 78. 2) History will show that nationwide closures and shutdowns were a historically colossal and manipulated “mistake” that transferred even more of the wealth (and soon property) to even less people, while we and our children will be paying for all of it through (obviously increased) taxes - for years and years and years. The death rate is insanely low and the victims were already headed towards hospice - which is the next step after being moved into an elder care facility (face reality - my father died from “respiratory failure” in a nursing home last year, and he surely would have been recorded as “covid” if he died this year instead). -- SO, how about let’s stop trying to get our local American businesses shut down. Let’s stop trying to get our local American citizens fired from their jobs. Let’s stop snitching on our American neighbors. Let’s stay home if we’re scared, and let’s live our lives if we're not. Shop on Amazon and make Jeff a trillionaire even faster if you must, that would be GREAT of you!! Or, put on your mask, if you feel like it of course - go out and support a local business, be nice to the people working and over tip the people who wait on you -- oh, and stop whining and being a snarky rat. I don’t care who you want for president -- let’s try to have a great America and a great life EITHER WAY!
