It is not a healthy solution that we have ever imposed on every healthy man, woman, and child for any other dangerous, infectious disease. Nor has it been effective. And it takes a toll on children’s mental health, their social skills, and their confidence. Last year, my daughter complained of head aches every day after school. Why is that an acceptable trade off when she only went to school while healthy? Besides, the kids have to take their masks off anyways at lunch, for sports, and can immediately take it off after school when they may be around many other people and friends, so it is pointless to make them suffer the rest of the day.  And I am concerned of what impacts it will have on their physical health long-term as their developing brains need oxygen. The parents who feel this virus is a real danger have the option to choose between wearing a mask or virtual school (which would be far more effective than just wearing a cloth.) But there needs to also be a choice for parents and children who want to give their children the same positive learning environment that all other generations prior to this have enjoyed. If our children are sick, they should stay home. And we should emphasize  proper hygiene. Why is it ok to consider overriding a state law and the governor’s executive order? Even those of us who strongly opposed the mandates last year still had to abide by them. Why is it ok to break the mandate this year? We need to be sensitive, understanding, and respectful to ‘all’ parents choices and every individual child’s needs.","petitionSlug":"fort-mill-school-district-board-of-trustees-protect-parents-choice-in-fort-mill-school-district","origin":"nomask","likes":"6","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/fort-mill-school-district-board-of-trustees-protect-parents-choice-in-fort-mill-school-district","author":"Betsy Logan","splitted":["And it takes a toll on"," children","’s mental"," health",", their social skills, and their confidence.

To me, that doesn't sound like an administration with a keen understanding of how this virus is unpredictable & the need to be proactive as well as preventative. This draft plan also doesn't include specifics for ventilation mitigation, nor does take into account that Delta does not require \"close contact\" to spread. You notify an entire classroom of families for lice & not a deadly disease. You've made it painfully clear that you did not mandate the mask policy for transportation.  I believe, if given the opportunity, you wouldn't have created that policy. I made my mind up long ago that I would remove bussing from our calculus in returning to in-person learning.

Last year some said “those afraid of the virus should stay home.” Now it’s time for those afraid of safety measures (like wearing masks) to stay home.","petitionSlug":"forsyth-county-board-of-education-georgia-follow-cdc-guidelines-in-schools-at-forsyth-county-ga","origin":"promask","likes":"3","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/forsyth-county-board-of-education-georgia-follow-cdc-guidelines-in-schools-at-forsyth-county-ga","author":"Kristie Kent","splitted":["For 18 months our"," family"," has followed"," ALL"," the mitigation measures and I’m so thankful that we have remained"," health","y."],"id":"b4979d1e-a09a-5d34-ae7f-1b6e5cb0ad94","commentableId":"30121307"},{"word":"risk","comment":"The lack of mask wearing indoors around Duluth puts me, my staff, and my community at risk.","petitionSlug":"duluth-mayor-emily-larson-make-masks-mandatory-in-public-in-duluth-mn-during-the-covid-19-pandemic","origin":"promask","likes":"4","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/duluth-mayor-emily-larson-make-masks-mandatory-in-public-in-duluth-mn-during-the-covid-19-pandemic","author":"Marcy Standage","splitted":["The lack of"," mask"," wearing indoors around Duluth puts me, my staff, and my community at"," risk","."],"id":"542532e4-7ad3-5c2b-bc22-8a2500c36813","commentableId":"23136641"},{"word":"risk","comment":"We have an obligation to our at risk neighbors, essential workers and the community at large to keep each other safe.","petitionSlug":"milwaukee-should-require-masks-in-public-places-to-protect-residents","origin":"promask","likes":"4","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/milwaukee-should-require-masks-in-public-places-to-protect-residents","author":"Danny Tyksinski","splitted":["We have an obligation to our at"," risk"," neighbors, essential workers and the community at large to keep each other safe."],"id":"1365acad-18e4-55cc-a8c5-90f3aa53ee78","commentableId":"22976515"},{"word":"risk","comment":"I have high risk people I care about!","petitionSlug":"duluth-mayor-emily-larson-make-masks-mandatory-in-public-in-duluth-mn-during-the-covid-19-pandemic","origin":"promask","likes":"4","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/duluth-mayor-emily-larson-make-masks-mandatory-in-public-in-duluth-mn-during-the-covid-19-pandemic","author":"Kathleen Wilson","splitted":["I have high"," risk",""," people"," I care about!"],"id":"69ec2981-44d2-5854-b225-5fac7bf357c1","commentableId":"23136641"},{"word":"risk","comment":"I would like to continue to attend in person class whilst keeping my at risk roommate safe","petitionSlug":"texas-a-m-university-office-of-the-provost-keep-texas-a-m-s-current-face-covering-policy-in-place-after-march-10","origin":"promask","likes":"4","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/texas-a-m-university-office-of-the-provost-keep-texas-a-m-s-current-face-covering-policy-in-place-after-march-10","author":"Katherine Szymanski","splitted":["I would like to continue to attend in person class whilst keeping my at"," risk"," roommate safe"],"id":"6f4edf07-05c4-5ae8-956e-9e2fd5d240bc","commentableId":"27645137"},{"word":"risk","comment":"I think it’s utterly irresponsible.

As a healthcare professional, I put stock in the recommendations for the American Pediatric Academy, and their recommendations that any child over the age of 2 - regardless of vaccination status - should be masked while inside. CISD did not have numerous COVID cases last year because 1) everyone had a mask on and 2) the Wuhan strain is not Delta. On Thursday, the 2nd day of school, I was notified of a positive COVID case within my child's class. 3 of 24 children are masked and the teacher will not remind masked children to wear properly. I have offered to purchase wipes and Lysol spray. That has not been acted upon. If CISD is not putting into place other protective measures (e.g. using misters, wiping and cleaning classrooms, hand sanitizer, air filtration systems) in at least elementary the easiest thing to do is a mask mandate.  As a mother I am wrestling with the virtual program option that seems punitive in substance for those children who may participate. My child has already been to class and if is pulled will be reshuffled in a different class in Jan. I feel that is cruel as well. She should be able to return to the class where she has made a relationship.  Parents trust that the Central Office and Administration will protect our children. A mask is not political, it is protection - plain and simple.  That we have gotten here as a society is heart wrenching.

Source: your local epidemiologist. \n\nThere’s no lack of anecdotal evidence that pediatric hospitals are reaching capacity in many states. \nIn the past week, 121,427 kids tested positive for COVID19, which represented 18% of the weekly reported cases in the United States. This is increasing at an exponential rate, but adult cases are also increasing exponentially.\n\nIn 23 states, 1.9% of child COVID-19 cases resulted in hospitalization. Last Saturday, 1,902 kids were hospitalized for COVID19. The CDC has also made MIS-C (serious condition associated with COVID-19) data publicly available. As of July 31, 4,404 kids were diagnosed with MIS-C associated with COVID19 in the United States.\n\nWe are very lucky that kids aren’t as high of risk for severe disease as older adults. But, even given this, I’m still concerned about three things…\n\n***First, the rate in which hospitalizations are increasing.*** We are far beyond the January peak, which is particularly apparent in the South (second graph). This could be due to pandemic fatigue (we just don’t care anymore). Or this could be due to Delta being more serious than previous variants. There is preliminary evidence from Scotland and Canada that adult hospitalization is more severe with Delta. We have yet to see kid data, but I don’t have reason to believe that it’s different.\n\n***Second, pediatric ICU (PICU) capacity.*** We desperately need to flatten the pediatric hospital curve. Only ~38% of kids have “natural” immunity and the majority of kids aren’t eligible for vaccines, which means we have an estimated 34 million susceptible children in the United States. If 1.9% of infected children are hospitalized, 33% of the kids go to the PICU, and the average hospital stay is 4 days, that means we need 6,800 PICU beds. The U.S. only has 4,500 PICU beds total. (If you want to check the math, go to this amazing thread by Dr. Denise Dewald).\n\nWe could easily overwhelm our pediatric hospitals. And this is just with COVID19. RSV is also at an all time high. Car accidents and drownings, for example, are also still happening in the background. We can’t just put kids in adult hospital beds. Kids aren’t tiny adults, they need special equipment, correct dosages, and trained hospital staff (who are getting more and more difficult to find because they are burned out). We also can’t just systematically fly children from Texas (where hospitals are full) to Maryland (where hospitals aren’t full).\n\nWhat schools do (or do not do) will impact case growth and, thus, impact how our hospitals fare too. A group of scientists in North Carolina modeled what may happen across schools that implement masks and/or surveillance testing. Without masks or regular testing, up to 90% of susceptible students may become infected by the end of the semester. \n\n***Third, kids’ role in the transmission chain.*** Yesterday, an important study was published in JAMA. Scientists sought out to answer how kids of all ages transit COVID19 in Canadian households from June 1 and December 31, 2020. They studied both the index cases and the rate of transmission in the household.","petitionSlug":"residents-of-middletown-nj-middletown-masks","origin":"promask","likes":"3","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/residents-of-middletown-nj-middletown-masks","author":"Sarah Ring","splitted":["We are very lucky that"," kids"," aren’t as high of"," risk"," for severe disease as older adults."],"id":"db33ce02-b13e-5270-bd93-917f17c43240","commentableId":"30421601"},{"word":"risk","comment":"Not wearing a mask has been proven to spread covid.

These schools now mandate masking and have proper mitigation practices, but only after hundreds of students fell ill and many more were quarantined.   Why does school leadership take the lives of our children and their staff so lightly?  There are currently better mitigation practices for head lice than there are for covid at CCISD.  Physicians, the CDC, AAP and epidemiologists all agree that masking, proper isolation/quarantine, vaccination and social distancing are ALL necessary in surge areas, which we clearly are.  Children under 12 cannot get the vaccine and our overall vaccination for even older kids is very low.  There are currently no pediatric ICU beds open in this area—where will we send kids who get sick as they will get sick since delta covid is as contagious as chicken pox and has almost 3x higher risk for pediatric hospitalization as compared to earlier strains?  There are federal funds for schools to implement online learning—why is this not happening?  This pandemic is real and worse than last year when students were actually masked and had online options.  If nothing can be done, then CCISD really needs to consider delaying school opening several weeks until this surge improves.  Hospitals is this area are already beyond capacity—the community has every right to blame the school leadership for poor outcomes from school related infections if schools have no real preventive practices in place.  Please do what is right for the health of our kids and community—this is not a matter of politics or preference.","petitionSlug":"clear-creek-isd-mandate-masks-in-clear-creek-isd","origin":"promask","likes":"2","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/clear-creek-isd-mandate-masks-in-clear-creek-isd","author":"Farrah Siddiqui","splitted":["Children under 12 cannot get the"," vaccine"," and our overall vaccination for even older"," kids"," is very low."],"id":"6ba1b1b2-2cc9-578e-b9f5-a17733b7731b","commentableId":"30325071"},{"word":"vaccine","comment":"My vaccinated senior child wants to have the best senior year and is will a bit of discomfort to to this.

Notification of not being able to wear the mask due to health reasons should be provided by a person's healthcare provider. The policy suggestion of allowing a parent, guardian, possibly a student, write a letter to be excused from wearing a mask should not be passed. Verification should come from a healthcare provider, who has the training and credentials to make a recommendation that not only affects their patient, but the people around them. We don't accept a parent's word for it that their child is well enough to participate in sports, for example, but require a medical clearance.

It's been well-established by medical experts that, with this particular virus, wearing masks is one of the absolute most important and effective things we can do to protect EVERYONE. To knowingly ignore this is negligent and reprehensible. That said, it only works if we ALL (with the exception of those with valid health issues) take responsibility and wear them CONSISTENTLY.  It must be mandated in order to work.\n\nUnfortunately, \"Strongly recommending\" or \"Strongly encouraging\" simply won't suffice. That type of verbiage will not be enough and we all know this. Peer pressure amongst students (\"he's not wearing one, so neither will I\") will quickly cause decreasing numbers of mask-wearers by the day. \n\nWhile I personally do not feel that elementary-age children wearing masks ALL DAY (through 7 hours of instruction, inside their \"family modell\" classroom) is feasible or prudent , I do, however, feel very strongly that in order to strike a compromise while still best protecting our children AND our teachers, bus drivers, and other adult staff (who are indispensable and far more vulnerable), masks should be MANDATORY in FOUR key areas/times: \n 1. Buses 2. Hallways/Common Areas 3. Arrival and 4. Dismissal.  \nMandating masks in these locations and situations makes complete sense given the much larger groups and wider exposure, which is inevitable and very concerning.  \n\nThis is not asking too much of our children. They CAN do this. But they need adults (*parents and *administrators) to set an example. If there's anything we need to TEACH our children, it's that we must care for one another and do what's necessary to get this under control. By mandating masks during key areas and times, we can protect everyone and decrease the spread. \n\nIf other schools and states can do this, SO CAN WE. Sadly, our state has failed miserably to slow the spread of COVID-19.  Our numbers are abysmal and terrifying- among the highest in the WORLD. We have to stand up and do what is right. To do WHAT WORKS to contain the virus. Fort Mill School District's motto is \"Children First...Every Day.\"  Our district needs to DEMONSTRATE this. We MUST protect our children's health and safety, more than anything else. \n\nEnforcing a MASK *RULE will do just that. It will save lives...of both teachers and students (as well as families, friends, and others in our beloved community). To do anything less is beyond careless and is guaranteed to result in far more absences, quarantines, shut downs, teacher loss, and tragedies.","petitionSlug":"fort-mill-school-district-administration-board-of-trustees-mandate-masks-in-the-fort-mill-school-district","origin":"promask","likes":"1","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/fort-mill-school-district-administration-board-of-trustees-mandate-masks-in-the-fort-mill-school-district","author":"Kendra Ryan","splitted":["Unfortunately, \"Strongly recommending\" or \"Strongly encouraging\" simply won't suffice.
