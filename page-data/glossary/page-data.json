I don’t understand who is denying the stats. COVID-19 is HIGHLY contagious and is transmitted through aerosols. The one logical, and scientifically proven way of preventing this is by wearing a mask.

Think about those who are immuno-compromised, children, or those with elders at home. They are high at risk. We need to do our best to protect everyone in our community.

The recommendation that all students and teachers K-8 should still wear masks regardless of vaccination status, sets a dangerous precedent. Local districts need to stand against this recommendation because enforcing masks on children due to vaccination status will ultimately require all public school students to get the vaccine. I can promise you that many of my students and parents will not support the bullied vaccination of their children. That’s the dangerous precedent/path we have before us. We can not allow this to happen. I saw first hand how the masks effected the students socially and emotionally throughout the entire school year. Being back in the classroom versus online was much more beneficial for students academically. We never had major issues with covid and cases were minimal. I believe this was not because of the masks but because of what the science says about children and this virus. In spite of the science when we had a case, students STILL had to quarantine who were in close contact. This effected student learning to a large degree, but that’s an issue for another day. I chose to get the vaccine because I thought it would help our chances of not wearing masks next school year and I wanted to protect my pregnant wife and then newborn son. We have to start thinking logically on this, not politically, and not out fear. The science states that children experience lower infection rate, are less likely to transmit the virus, and are not primary drivers of community transmission. The science also states that children are 43% as susceptible to Covid-19 and they transmit the virus 63% of an adults transmission rate.(https://www.healthline.com/health-news/kids-are-half-as-likely-get-covid-19-as-adults-heres-what-we-know#Why-are-kids-less-susceptible-to-COVID-19? ) Not to mention nearly 50% of NC’s population is fully vaccinated. With all of this combined and the vaccination of adults in the school system. There is NO need to wear the masks this school year. This path will lead to a decrease in public education attendance. It will also lead to parents and communities losing faith and trust in the public education system. I hope my story will resonate with others. I do not post my political opinions for everyone to see, but I felt that someone in the system needed to speak out about this issue. Help spread the word and speak out about this issue. Nothing will change if we don’t let our voices be heard.","petitionSlug":"roy-cooper-unmask-our-children-at-school","origin":"nomask","likes":"2","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/roy-cooper-unmask-our-children-at-school","author":"User83334","createdAt":"5 months ago","splitted":["The ","science"," states that ","children"," experience lower infection rate, are less likely to transmit the virus, and are not primary drivers of ","community"," transmission."],"id":"39cc6707-b01b-54df-8341-1e493f7df0ad","commentableId":"29533236"},{"word":"community","comment":"Those who want to mask up, mask up.

He did the same in preschool. My second grader wears his after a year of virtual school. Yet, as one of only two who mask in his KG classroom, my younger son got sick in two weeks. That doesn’t prove masks don't work; it shows that masks work BEST when *everyone* is wearing them to contain their own germs. Look at what RSV is doing to kids and the healthcare system. It shows the power that masks had on protecting kids from A LOT of illnesses last year. It also reveals the consequences of lifting the mandates. My son’s illness is fairly mild because of his mask. His mask did more to protect the others in his class from the cold he’s been incubating and would have been spreading, while he almost certainly picked up this virus (thank God not COVID) from someone who was sick and unmasked at school. HE missed a day of class and I missed a day of work to get him rested & tested & checked & cleared because we care about the classroom being safe for everyone. Mandate masks *now* before we reach the case thresholds so more kids can avoid the fear we had to endure AND stay in-person full-time. No it’s not ideal, but community is built from shared sacrifice and goals. Let’s teach our kids that protecting each other is worth a little inconvenience. Kids will thrive and adapt. They’ll follow if we lead. And if in-person is the priority, mandate masks to PREVENT an outbreak, not after one is already rampaging.","petitionSlug":"cg-superintendint-and-cg-school-board-keep-our-center-grove-students-safe-start-with-a-mask-mandate","origin":"promask","likes":"10","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/cg-superintendint-and-cg-school-board-keep-our-center-grove-students-safe-start-with-a-mask-mandate","author":"User55987","createdAt":"4 months ago","splitted":["His mask did more to protect the others in his class from the cold he’s been incubating and would have been spreading, while he almost certainly picked up this virus (thank God not ","COVID",") from someone who was sick and unmasked at ","school","."],"id":"e74540ff-d85a-5971-80d0-a758bad8fc91","commentableId":"30406071"},{"word":"covid","comment":"I’m signing because vaccines are wearing off, covid is spreading, kids under 12 cannot even get vaccinated, and even pediatricians are very concerned about the delta variant in kids.

Ignoring the scientific facts on the dangers of SARS Co-V 2 mutations, that are occurring from unchecked transmission, in unvaccinated people, and the efficacy of masks to curb this spread, is simply ignorant. Children in other states attending school in-person are becoming ill, filling pediatric wards all over the country. These mutations are making our children and everyone else, more vulnerable to illness, and possible devastating covid long-term effects. This is a real life experiment, we must all pay attention to. Children do not live in a bubble. Our community is full of people at risk of severe illness and death, even when vaccinated, including: cancer patients, those with autoimmune diseases, primary immune diseases, transplant patients, and people over 65 whose immune systems are compromised by age. Parents against masks are teaching their children to be narcissists, instead of caring, community members.

COVID-19 mask mandates are meant to control and divide us, and the plan is working quite well. Reading through the comments, It seems obvious that those who support this petition have only ever been an employee and never owned a retail type business. It would be an insidious, deplorable act for any government agency to FORCE their local businesses to be the \"mask police\"... Escort people out? Spend money hiring \"security guards\" to keep the non-conformists away?? WHAT? Its like the movies Red Dawn and Idiocracy mixed together -- the Russians and the Cubans have taken over America, and they rely on the weak to snitch out those who don’t fall in line. My issues with masks are as follows: 1) Masks don’t work, it even says so on the box. Walmart requires masks nationwide? Good! THEY’RE ON AISLE 78. 2) History will show that nationwide closures and shutdowns were a historically colossal and manipulated “mistake” that transferred even more of the wealth (and soon property) to even less people, while we and our children will be paying for all of it through (obviously increased) taxes - for years and years and years. The death rate is insanely low and the victims were already headed towards hospice - which is the next step after being moved into an elder care facility (face reality - my father died from “respiratory failure” in a nursing home last year, and he surely would have been recorded as “covid” if he died this year instead). -- SO, how about let’s stop trying to get our local American businesses shut down. Let’s stop trying to get our local American citizens fired from their jobs. Let’s stop snitching on our American neighbors. Let’s stay home if we’re scared, and let’s live our lives if we're not. Shop on Amazon and make Jeff a trillionaire even faster if you must, that would be GREAT of you!! Or, put on your mask, if you feel like it of course - go out and support a local business, be nice to the people working and over tip the people who wait on you -- oh, and stop whining and being a snarky rat. I don’t care who you want for president -- let’s try to have a great America and a great life EITHER WAY!

There most certainly will be community spread if you leave masks optional. It’s clear that the the general population are ignoring optional mask requests from CDC as (at best) 70% of locals are vaccinated yet I never see 30% of the people out and about wearing masks indoors.\n\nParents who are returning to in person work will not have the option to do NACA again this fall. They will be forced to send their kids in person, even if it’s riskier than remote learning. Teachers will have the added stress of trying to help parents who want their kids to be masked to keep them on.\n\nThe school district should make masks required until all students have had the opportunity to be fully vaccinated. These students are minors and cannot be left on their own to make a decision about wearing a mask or not in buildings. Masks do not add difficulty to the daily routines of 99% of students.","petitionSlug":"north-allegheny-school-district-board-mandate-masks-in-nasd-for-school-kids-under-12-until-kids-can-be-fully-vaccinated","origin":"promask","likes":"3","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/north-allegheny-school-district-board-mandate-masks-in-nasd-for-school-kids-under-12-until-kids-can-be-fully-vaccinated","author":"User30465","createdAt":"5 months ago","splitted":["These students are minors and cannot be left on their own to make a ","decision"," about wearing a mask or not in buildings."],"id":"f1cb6e2e-ba63-53ae-92dd-993ad0b008b5","commentableId":"29975392"},{"word":"decision","comment":"Opelika City Schools is mandating masks for anyone in their buildings, including students.

It is not a healthy solution that we have ever imposed on every healthy man, woman, and child for any other dangerous, infectious disease. Nor has it been effective. And it takes a toll on children’s mental health, their social skills, and their confidence. Last year, my daughter complained of head aches every day after school. Why is that an acceptable trade off when she only went to school while healthy? Besides, the kids have to take their masks off anyways at lunch, for sports, and can immediately take it off after school when they may be around many other people and friends, so it is pointless to make them suffer the rest of the day.  And I am concerned of what impacts it will have on their physical health long-term as their developing brains need oxygen. The parents who feel this virus is a real danger have the option to choose between wearing a mask or virtual school (which would be far more effective than just wearing a cloth.) But there needs to also be a choice for parents and children who want to give their children the same positive learning environment that all other generations prior to this have enjoyed. If our children are sick, they should stay home. And we should emphasize  proper hygiene. Why is it ok to consider overriding a state law and the governor’s executive order? Even those of us who strongly opposed the mandates last year still had to abide by them. Why is it ok to break the mandate this year?

To me, that doesn't sound like an administration with a keen understanding of how this virus is unpredictable & the need to be proactive as well as preventative. This draft plan also doesn't include specifics for ventilation mitigation, nor does take into account that Delta does not require \"close contact\" to spread. You notify an entire classroom of families for lice & not a deadly disease. You've made it painfully clear that you did not mandate the mask policy for transportation.

Multiple Studies and epidemiologists from around the world have concluded that masks are not appropriate for daily use by healthy people. I ask the city of River Falls to allow individual businesses to decide whether masks are appropriate or not and to support an individuals right to choose. Where there is so much conflicting scientific data,  there must be a choice!!!\nOur practice members have spoken and they overwhelmingly reject the notion of wearing a mask as a mandated procedure, and choose masks when in higher risk populations such as visiting an elderly relative.","petitionSlug":"citizens-of-river-falls-require-river-falls-wi-businesses-to-keep-face-masks-voluntary","origin":"promask","likes":"3","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/citizens-of-river-falls-require-river-falls-wi-businesses-to-keep-face-masks-voluntary","author":"User92806","createdAt":"a year ago","splitted":["Our practice members have spoken and they overwhelmingly reject the notion of wearing a mask as a mandated procedure, and choose masks when in higher ","risk"," populations such as visiting an elderly relative."],"id":"05b39430-effb-5400-a987-dfe86bae0221","commentableId":"23590525"},{"word":"risk","comment":"Masks are a necessary part of slowing down the spread of Covid-19.

Source: your local epidemiologist. \n\nThere’s no lack of anecdotal evidence that pediatric hospitals are reaching capacity in many states. \nIn the past week, 121,427 kids tested positive for COVID19, which represented 18% of the weekly reported cases in the United States. This is increasing at an exponential rate, but adult cases are also increasing exponentially.\n\nIn 23 states, 1.9% of child COVID-19 cases resulted in hospitalization. Last Saturday, 1,902 kids were hospitalized for COVID19. The CDC has also made MIS-C (serious condition associated with COVID-19) data publicly available. As of July 31, 4,404 kids were diagnosed with MIS-C associated with COVID19 in the United States.\n\nWe are very lucky that kids aren’t as high of risk for severe disease as older adults. But, even given this, I’m still concerned about three things…\n\n***First, the rate in which hospitalizations are increasing.*** We are far beyond the January peak, which is particularly apparent in the South (second graph). This could be due to pandemic fatigue (we just don’t care anymore). Or this could be due to Delta being more serious than previous variants. There is preliminary evidence from Scotland and Canada that adult hospitalization is more severe with Delta. We have yet to see kid data, but I don’t have reason to believe that it’s different.\n\n***Second, pediatric ICU (PICU) capacity.*** We desperately need to flatten the pediatric hospital curve. Only ~38% of kids have “natural” immunity and the majority of kids aren’t eligible for vaccines, which means we have an estimated 34 million susceptible children in the United States. If 1.9% of infected children are hospitalized, 33% of the kids go to the PICU, and the average hospital stay is 4 days, that means we need 6,800 PICU beds. The U.S. only has 4,500 PICU beds total. (If you want to check the math, go to this amazing thread by Dr. Denise Dewald).\n\nWe could easily overwhelm our pediatric hospitals. And this is just with COVID19. RSV is also at an all time high. Car accidents and drownings, for example, are also still happening in the background. We can’t just put kids in adult hospital beds. Kids aren’t tiny adults, they need special equipment, correct dosages, and trained hospital staff (who are getting more and more difficult to find because they are burned out). We also can’t just systematically fly children from Texas (where hospitals are full) to Maryland (where hospitals aren’t full).\n\nWhat schools do (or do not do) will impact case growth and, thus, impact how our hospitals fare too. A group of scientists in North Carolina modeled what may happen across schools that implement masks and/or surveillance testing. Without masks or regular testing, up to 90% of susceptible students may become infected by the end of the semester. \n\n***Third, kids’ role in the transmission chain.*** Yesterday, an important study was published in JAMA. Scientists sought out to answer how kids of all ages transit COVID19 in Canadian households from June 1 and December 31, 2020. They studied both the index cases and the rate of transmission in the household.","petitionSlug":"residents-of-middletown-nj-middletown-masks","origin":"promask","likes":"3","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/residents-of-middletown-nj-middletown-masks","author":"User72111","createdAt":"4 months ago","splitted":["We are very lucky that kids aren’t as high of ","risk"," for severe disease as older adults."],"id":"5e0b714b-9da0-5d37-bb88-fc22f474eed4","commentableId":"30421601"},{"word":"risk","comment":"Not wearing a mask has been proven to spread covid.

This rule was the only reason my mother (who has always had asthma and is in her late 50s) let my sister go back to physical school at all. If there is not a mask mandate, then there might be parents who are at risk like her who won’t let there kids go to school who then will subsequently receive a lower quality of education.

Notification of not being able to wear the mask due to health reasons should be provided by a person's healthcare provider. The policy suggestion of allowing a parent, guardian, possibly a student, write a letter to be excused from wearing a mask should not be passed. Verification should come from a healthcare provider, who has the training and credentials to make a recommendation that not only affects their patient, but the people around them. We don't accept a parent's word for it that their child is well enough to participate in sports, for example, but require a medical clearance. During a public health crisis, medical personnel are the appropriate people to verify this.

As a healthcare professional, I put stock in the recommendations for the American Pediatric Academy, and their recommendations that any child over the age of 2 - regardless of vaccination status - should be masked while inside. CISD did not have numerous COVID cases last year because 1) everyone had a mask on and 2) the Wuhan strain is not Delta. On Thursday, the 2nd day of school, I was notified of a positive COVID case within my child's class. 3 of 24 children are masked and the teacher will not remind masked children to wear properly. I have offered to purchase wipes and Lysol spray. That has not been acted upon. If CISD is not putting into place other protective measures (e.g. using misters, wiping and cleaning classrooms, hand sanitizer, air filtration systems) in at least elementary the easiest thing to do is a mask mandate.  As a mother I am wrestling with the virtual program option that seems punitive in substance for those children who may participate. My child has already been to class and if is pulled will be reshuffled in a different class in Jan. I feel that is cruel as well. She should be able to return to the class where she has made a relationship.  Parents trust that the Central Office and Administration will protect our children.

It's been well-established by medical experts that, with this particular virus, wearing masks is one of the absolute most important and effective things we can do to protect EVERYONE. To knowingly ignore this is negligent and reprehensible. That said, it only works if we ALL (with the exception of those with valid health issues) take responsibility and wear them CONSISTENTLY.  It must be mandated in order to work.\n\nUnfortunately, \"Strongly recommending\" or \"Strongly encouraging\" simply won't suffice. That type of verbiage will not be enough and we all know this. Peer pressure amongst students (\"he's not wearing one, so neither will I\") will quickly cause decreasing numbers of mask-wearers by the day. \n\nWhile I personally do not feel that elementary-age children wearing masks ALL DAY (through 7 hours of instruction, inside their \"family modell\" classroom) is feasible or prudent , I do, however, feel very strongly that in order to strike a compromise while still best protecting our children AND our teachers, bus drivers, and other adult staff (who are indispensable and far more vulnerable), masks should be MANDATORY in FOUR key areas/times: \n 1. Buses 2. Hallways/Common Areas 3. Arrival and 4. Dismissal.  \nMandating masks in these locations and situations makes complete sense given the much larger groups and wider exposure, which is inevitable and very concerning.  \n\nThis is not asking too much of our children. They CAN do this. But they need adults (*parents and *administrators) to set an example. If there's anything we need to TEACH our children, it's that we must care for one another and do what's necessary to get this under control. By mandating masks during key areas and times, we can protect everyone and decrease the spread. \n\nIf other schools and states can do this, SO CAN WE. Sadly, our state has failed miserably to slow the spread of COVID-19.  Our numbers are abysmal and terrifying- among the highest in the WORLD. We have to stand up and do what is right. To do WHAT WORKS to contain the virus. Fort Mill School District's motto is \"Children First...Every Day.\"  Our district needs to DEMONSTRATE this.

These schools now mandate masking and have proper mitigation practices, but only after hundreds of students fell ill and many more were quarantined.   Why does school leadership take the lives of our children and their staff so lightly?  There are currently better mitigation practices for head lice than there are for covid at CCISD.  Physicians, the CDC, AAP and epidemiologists all agree that masking, proper isolation/quarantine, vaccination and social distancing are ALL necessary in surge areas, which we clearly are.  Children under 12 cannot get the vaccine and our overall vaccination for even older kids is very low.  There are currently no pediatric ICU beds open in this area—where will we send kids who get sick as they will get sick since delta covid is as contagious as chicken pox and has almost 3x higher risk for pediatric hospitalization as compared to earlier strains?  There are federal funds for schools to implement online learning—why is this not happening?  This pandemic is real and worse than last year when students were actually masked and had online options.  If nothing can be done, then CCISD really needs to consider delaying school opening several weeks until this surge improves.  Hospitals is this area are already beyond capacity—the community has every right to blame the school leadership for poor outcomes from school related infections if schools have no real preventive practices in place.  Please do what is right for the health of our kids and community—this is not a matter of politics or preference.","petitionSlug":"clear-creek-isd-mandate-masks-in-clear-creek-isd","origin":"promask","likes":"2","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/clear-creek-isd-mandate-masks-in-clear-creek-isd","author":"User96020","createdAt":"4 months ago","splitted":["","Children"," under 12 cannot get the ","vaccine"," and our overall vaccination for even older kids is very low."],"id":"29a0d487-87fc-57c2-86ba-e2d6935cf3b0","commentableId":"30325071"},{"word":"vaccine","comment":"My vaccinated senior child wants to have the best senior year and is will a bit of discomfort to to this.
