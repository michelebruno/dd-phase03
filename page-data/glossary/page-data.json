There’s a reason more businesses and organizations are making it mandatory. There is a reason that masks are required for everyone at Mayo Clinic  even after temperature checks and two sets of questions. We owe it to our essential workers everywhere to protect them. Beyond that, as a transplant recipient, I selfishly want people to understand that hand hygiene, wearing masks, and washing them can really make a difference. I think all of this should be a part of a campaign. I have taught strength and conditioning sessions in a mask, had hundreds if not thousands of conversations, and will still wear a mask in situations when the pandemic passes. Again, combined with adequate hand hygiene in the form of carrying sanitizer with me and washing my hands and masks, I do all the things I can to minimize my own exposure. If we want this thing to have a chance of ending quicker, this is a simple measure to help contribute to keeping our citizens healthy. This especially pertains to  those people that have even weaker immune systems then me, have other complicating factors, or are at greater risk because of time of exposure or lack of resources. \n\nIt’s my opinion that I think it is hard for people to imagine what it is like to be really sick, or how that would feel for another person.

I don’t want people to have to experience that to understand that getting very ill is awful. It’s awful on your body, mind, and soul. Not everyone will get sick, but everyone with the disease has the chance to make another person sick.

To begin with, if a school has any form of dress code then it is contradictory to say that a mask mandate could not be enforced. If you can dictate how someone dresses, you can do the same for masks. On the topic of contradictions, is it not a bit odd that the safety of your students and staff members is purportedly your number one priority yet you have not taken this action which would greatly enhance the safety of your students/staff. Additionally, we must not only consider the safety of the students and staff themselves, but also their friends and family who may be immunocompromised or otherwise in a state of heightened vulnerability to the complications that SARS-CoV-2 often produces such as pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism, ischemic stroke, and myocardial infarction just to name a few. Some may attempt to present the argument that “masks make it hard to breathe”...this could not be further from the truth. It may make it FEEL more difficult due to the sensation of something covering their airways, but it is simply that, a sensation. Even with multiple masks on, it has been shown by numerous MDs and RNs that blood oxygen saturation (clinical indicator of the body’s ability to effectively respirate) is not affected whatsoever. \n\nPeople are dying and we are too selfish and concerned with our own comfort to wear a mask that could save the lives of ourselves, our friends, and our families.

I believe that masking will be the best bet to keeping kids learning in the physical schools and in front of teachers in person.  I keep replaying in my mind (former Secretary) Dr. Levine saying, “My mask protects you, and your mask protects me.” It does no good if only some people are masking. The unmasked are like broken links in a chain. If we aren’t all linked (in a socially distant and masked kind of way), we can’t be effective in our mitigation efforts. This virus is equal opportunity.  It looks for weak links in our armor.  Knowing how it enters the body, why on earth would we do anything but mask, knowing that social distancing is not promised.  Science is not political.  It is not biased.  We cannot let our decision making be biased in response to this virus. \n \nAs you know, regardless of whether we are vaccinated, vaccinated people can still contract and/or carry the virus, spreading it to others. I worry about the older kids bringing it home. My younger two kids can’t be vaccinated, and I am of the sincere mindset that requiring masks and doing everything possible to socially distance are actions that will achieve the greatest good for the greatest number of people in the end. In the grand scheme of things, they are small sacrifices.   I am not speaking solely on behalf of my family, and I pray that you won’t either.

We have laws against this. \n\nHowever, this is not really the argument parents are making even if they don’t know it. The true argument a parent is making in attempting to assert “parents rights” over their child wearing a mask is really that they have a right to put other children at risk. If one’s child is infected,  goes unmasked and infects another child (which, is much more likely than if the infected child wore a mask), the parent’s “right” was to choose that the other child got sick. While it’s true that the other child’s chance of getting sick is reduced if they wear a mask, it is not reduced to 0% chance. It’s reduced maybe by half. The parent absolutely does not have a right to make their child a public threat. This makes a mockery of other important, meaningful rights in the name of an irresponsible, thoughtless and careless desire. This is not the American character and it has nothing to do with freedom or rights - only putting children and their future, our future, at risk over extreme selfishness. \n\nParents - put on your big girl/boy pants.

Think about those who are immuno-compromised, children, or those with elders at home. They are high at risk. We need to do our best to protect everyone in our community.

The recommendation that all students and teachers K-8 should still wear masks regardless of vaccination status, sets a dangerous precedent. Local districts need to stand against this recommendation because enforcing masks on children due to vaccination status will ultimately require all public school students to get the vaccine. I can promise you that many of my students and parents will not support the bullied vaccination of their children. That’s the dangerous precedent/path we have before us. We can not allow this to happen. I saw first hand how the masks effected the students socially and emotionally throughout the entire school year. Being back in the classroom versus online was much more beneficial for students academically. We never had major issues with covid and cases were minimal. I believe this was not because of the masks but because of what the science says about children and this virus. In spite of the science when we had a case, students STILL had to quarantine who were in close contact. This effected student learning to a large degree, but that’s an issue for another day. I chose to get the vaccine because I thought it would help our chances of not wearing masks next school year and I wanted to protect my pregnant wife and then newborn son. We have to start thinking logically on this, not politically, and not out fear. The science states that children experience lower infection rate, are less likely to transmit the virus, and are not primary drivers of community transmission. The science also states that children are 43% as susceptible to Covid-19 and they transmit the virus 63% of an adults transmission rate.(https://www.healthline.com/health-news/kids-are-half-as-likely-get-covid-19-as-adults-heres-what-we-know#Why-are-kids-less-susceptible-to-COVID-19? ) Not to mention nearly 50% of NC’s population is fully vaccinated. With all of this combined and the vaccination of adults in the school system. There is NO need to wear the masks this school year. This path will lead to a decrease in public education attendance. It will also lead to parents and communities losing faith and trust in the public education system. I hope my story will resonate with others. I do not post my political opinions for everyone to see, but I felt that someone in the system needed to speak out about this issue. Help spread the word and speak out about this issue. Nothing will change if we don’t let our voices be heard.","petitionSlug":"roy-cooper-unmask-our-children-at-school","origin":"nomask","likes":"2","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/roy-cooper-unmask-our-children-at-school","author":"User64135","createdAt":"5 months ago","splitted":["The ","science"," states that ","children"," experience lower infection rate, are less likely to transmit the virus, and are not primary drivers of ","community"," transmission."],"id":"39cc6707-b01b-54df-8341-1e493f7df0ad","commentableId":"29533236"},{"word":"community","comment":"Those who want to mask up, mask up.

He did the same in preschool. My second grader wears his after a year of virtual school. Yet, as one of only two who mask in his KG classroom, my younger son got sick in two weeks. That doesn’t prove masks don't work; it shows that masks work BEST when *everyone* is wearing them to contain their own germs. Look at what RSV is doing to kids and the healthcare system. It shows the power that masks had on protecting kids from A LOT of illnesses last year. It also reveals the consequences of lifting the mandates. My son’s illness is fairly mild because of his mask. His mask did more to protect the others in his class from the cold he’s been incubating and would have been spreading, while he almost certainly picked up this virus (thank God not COVID) from someone who was sick and unmasked at school. HE missed a day of class and I missed a day of work to get him rested & tested & checked & cleared because we care about the classroom being safe for everyone. Mandate masks *now* before we reach the case thresholds so more kids can avoid the fear we had to endure AND stay in-person full-time. No it’s not ideal, but community is built from shared sacrifice and goals. Let’s teach our kids that protecting each other is worth a little inconvenience. Kids will thrive and adapt. They’ll follow if we lead. And if in-person is the priority, mandate masks to PREVENT an outbreak, not after one is already rampaging.","petitionSlug":"cg-superintendint-and-cg-school-board-keep-our-center-grove-students-safe-start-with-a-mask-mandate","origin":"promask","likes":"10","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/cg-superintendint-and-cg-school-board-keep-our-center-grove-students-safe-start-with-a-mask-mandate","author":"User77291","createdAt":"4 months ago","splitted":["His mask did more to protect the others in his class from the cold he’s been incubating and would have been spreading, while he almost certainly picked up this virus (thank God not ","COVID",") from someone who was sick and unmasked at ","school","."],"id":"e74540ff-d85a-5971-80d0-a758bad8fc91","commentableId":"30406071"},{"word":"covid","comment":"I’m signing because vaccines are wearing off, covid is spreading, kids under 12 cannot even get vaccinated, and even pediatricians are very concerned about the delta variant in kids.

COVID-19 mask mandates are meant to control and divide us, and the plan is working quite well. Reading through the comments, It seems obvious that those who support this petition have only ever been an employee and never owned a retail type business. It would be an insidious, deplorable act for any government agency to FORCE their local businesses to be the \"mask police\"... Escort people out? Spend money hiring \"security guards\" to keep the non-conformists away?? WHAT? Its like the movies Red Dawn and Idiocracy mixed together -- the Russians and the Cubans have taken over America, and they rely on the weak to snitch out those who don’t fall in line. My issues with masks are as follows: 1) Masks don’t work, it even says so on the box. Walmart requires masks nationwide? Good! THEY’RE ON AISLE 78. 2) History will show that nationwide closures and shutdowns were a historically colossal and manipulated “mistake” that transferred even more of the wealth (and soon property) to even less people, while we and our children will be paying for all of it through (obviously increased) taxes - for years and years and years. The death rate is insanely low and the victims were already headed towards hospice - which is the next step after being moved into an elder care facility (face reality - my father died from “respiratory failure” in a nursing home last year, and he surely would have been recorded as “covid” if he died this year instead). -- SO, how about let’s stop trying to get our local American businesses shut down. Let’s stop trying to get our local American citizens fired from their jobs. Let’s stop snitching on our American neighbors. Let’s stay home if we’re scared, and let’s live our lives if we're not. Shop on Amazon and make Jeff a trillionaire even faster if you must, that would be GREAT of you!! Or, put on your mask, if you feel like it of course - go out and support a local business, be nice to the people working and over tip the people who wait on you -- oh, and stop whining and being a snarky rat.

Clearly at least 4 of you are ignorant to the impacts on a person's lungs from wearing a mask.\n\nGod created the mouth and lungs to perform a function that isn't up for debate. Your recent decision to force masks back on the faces of children is as ignorant and weak minded as it was last year. \n\nI encourage parents to encourage children to throw them away, to resist the tyranny of your decision. I pray that every child everywhere will unite on school grounds, take hands, hug and sit in unity to show you that you have no right to control their bodies. Many of the children have no one to fight for them and because of powers like yours must learn early to stand for themselves.\n\nYour mask order is detrimental to every child who is forced to abide by it. \nThe exhaled product from lungs is toxic and meant to be released into the air to be filtered by nature. Your requirement forces every lung in every child to inhale the toxins back into their lungs. As educated people, I would expect you to understand at least that basic fact. \nTo explain further, your requirement is causing a toxic buildup of CO2 in every child's lungs. \nCO2 is heavy and sits in the lungs after a person exhales in a normal way. Over a period of time, undetermined by doctors, the CO2 causes life threatening issues. However, it's been proven that there are immediate ill effects such as a lightheaded feeling or feeling faint, overheating, confusion, coughing(which is the body's way of trying to expel the toxins), nausea and vomiting....over a period of time the lungs will cross a line that they cannot recover from.\nYour requirement goes against God's intentions. \n\nIf you choose to continue on this path of ignorance and abide by the fear put upon you by Roy Cooper's insistence that you force toxins into every child's lungs by demanding they cover their face, I assure you that resistance will grow. Only God knows how far the parents, guardians and even the children will go to put a stop to your tyranny. I stand with them.\n\nAs you may or may not know, Rowan County has made the news several times. For the most part, our citizens have refrained from going along with the current administration's requirements recommended by those who support the New World Order. One news reporter spoke of us as though we are simple rural folk who need to be educated and encouraged to conform. \n\nA lot of our citizens have chosen not to participate in the current drug trials and Roy Cooper seems to have a problem with that decision. \nOn behalf of myself and my simple rural folk friends, you can tell Roy Cooper to go to hell.\nInterested to know how many children I have in your school system? Well I'll tell you like God tells me,  they're all mine. \n\nSincerely \nCrystal R Lineberry","petitionSlug":"make-mask-optional-for-rowan-salisbury-schools","origin":"nomask","likes":"7","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/make-mask-optional-for-rowan-salisbury-schools","author":"User94462","createdAt":"4 months ago","splitted":["Your recent ","decision"," to force masks back on the faces of ","children"," is as ignorant and weak minded as it was last year.

To exclude a mask mandate from the in-person school option is to jeopardize the health and wellbeing of students, teachers, staff, family members, and the community at large. #Childrenfirst should put children's (and teachers') health first, education second, and politics a distant last. The debacle over the misleading teacher survey statistics was inexcusable. How can you put forth a plan that jeopardizes teachers' health, without their input, and without the support of over half of teachers? It's time to poll parents and teachers again, given the recent spike in SC COVID numbers and ask about how comfortable people feel without the protection of masks. I'm confident you would see drastically lower numbers now. This shouldn't be a political decision. The school board should draft an in-person plan that provides the least risk to keep the most amount of people healthy. And to do so would require you to follow CDC and Fort Mill in the mask requirements. \n\nSide note: I understand that you need to hire teachers for the Virtual Academy now, but asking parents to decide a month before school starts (and let's be real, a lot can change in month of COVID) is problematic, especially since you are making parents choose for the whole year.

My child is 11 yrs old & agenda a middle school where 75% of kids DO NOT wear masks!  She is not yet old enough to receive her vaccination. So she does everything she can to protect herself and her peers Pierce. Unfortunately the same as not being done for her. All variants of this virus are primarily spread through the air.   If a child who does not wear a mask Hazarvis, comma they go around spreading it around spreading it to everyone they come in contact with. Then, the kids/staff they infected do the same. It's a never ending cycle that can at least be better controlled with protection measures in place!  This is not about anyone's rights to wear or not wear a mask. What it is about is protecting one another from this horrible virus.  If you don't wanna wear a mask when you're at home that's fine it's fine but when you are around others who have to interact with you when you go in public such as school, the grocery store, government buildings and medical offices additional safety precautions need to be taken! This shouldn't even be a discussion!\n\nFurthermore, the UCPS BOE does NOT have the tools to teach the children who have been quarantined.  Remote learning consist of being being able to call all and leave messages for their teachers until 4:00 p.m. if they have questions & are told to consult the programs such as CampusED if they need further help. Otherwise, check the calendar and your email for assignments.  How this is not directly leaving a child behind I don't know!!  Is anyone really truly OK with these kids not learning anything anything while they are out and being left behind when it could be completely different?\n\nColleges have instructor led classes online students can attend by using a webcam. UCPS students could be learning the EXACT same way. Why are the teachers not being allowed to continue to teach as they normally would to their class of that are or as well? If they are in school and only a small number of students were quarantined, why can't a webcam be setup and focused on the teacher as he teaches the students physically in school while the quarantined students follow along from home? Same schedule, etc?\n\nThe UCPS BOE could have had this implemented before school started. It would only take a video messaging program coded for businesses, an internet connection and the Lenovo chromebooks that our students were assigned at the beginning of school.  That's literally it! Teachers could even assist the quarantined students one on one.  Granted it would not be perfect but it would absolutely be better than this! \n\nBetween the parents demanding their children have the RIGHT to wear or not wear a mask being unconcerned with the fact students and staff are being infected with this virus, half of the adults - parents, teachers and UCPS BOE - twiddling their thumbs as quarantined children are at home being left behind, not getting any education at all..... I have become literally disgusted with the so called community we live in. It's extremely disappointing. \n\n It's not only keeping the quarantine children from learning but it's also stopping the children currently in school from learning. Has anyone noticed the homework situation?  How there isn't any? At least that is the situation in middle school. There should have been homework last week, imo.  Children need homework to retain the information they ARE learning and while it hasn't been said specifically the issue is due to 5K children currently quarantined, I'm betting that's exactly what's happening. \n\nRather than sit here and wait for my child to be sent home for quarantine for to possible infection from other students, unprotected and constantly closely around her, I choose to fight this problem now.  I will fight  For her right to feel safe and BE SAFE while at school.  I will also fight to remove UCPS BOE as the responsible party for knowing and deciding what is best for all of our children, without ONCE consulting the parents of said children.  They clearly do not know what they're doing based on the number of children currently quarantined and their complete failure at establishing a successful method for quarantined children to learn! Every parent should be on the same page as myself at this point, unless they feel it's acceptable for the children to not recieve an education altogether. Every board member, aside for the one individual who finally went against the grain, should be removed from their position and that includes Houlihan.","petitionSlug":"roy-cooper-masks-for-all-in-school-897312d3-7987-4494-baff-95f49fe04fe3","origin":"promask","likes":"0","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/roy-cooper-masks-for-all-in-school-897312d3-7987-4494-baff-95f49fe04fe3","author":"User72974","createdAt":"3 months ago","splitted":["If you don't wanna wear a mask when you're at home that's fine it's fine but when you are around others who have to interact with you when you go in ","public"," such as ","school",", the grocery store, government buildings and medical offices additional ","safety"," precautions need to be taken!"],"id":"b83a45af-8537-561c-ad22-79f5e2d280e7","commentableId":"30406306"},{"word":"government","comment":"No signing this crap!!!

It is not a healthy solution that we have ever imposed on every healthy man, woman, and child for any other dangerous, infectious disease. Nor has it been effective. And it takes a toll on children’s mental health, their social skills, and their confidence. Last year, my daughter complained of head aches every day after school. Why is that an acceptable trade off when she only went to school while healthy? Besides, the kids have to take their masks off anyways at lunch, for sports, and can immediately take it off after school when they may be around many other people and friends, so it is pointless to make them suffer the rest of the day.  And I am concerned of what impacts it will have on their physical health long-term as their developing brains need oxygen. The parents who feel this virus is a real danger have the option to choose between wearing a mask or virtual school (which would be far more effective than just wearing a cloth.) But there needs to also be a choice for parents and children who want to give their children the same positive learning environment that all other generations prior to this have enjoyed. If our children are sick, they should stay home. And we should emphasize  proper hygiene. Why is it ok to consider overriding a state law and the governor’s executive order? Even those of us who strongly opposed the mandates last year still had to abide by them. Why is it ok to break the mandate this year? We need to be sensitive, understanding, and respectful to ‘all’ parents choices and every individual child’s needs.","petitionSlug":"fort-mill-school-district-board-of-trustees-protect-parents-choice-in-fort-mill-school-district","origin":"nomask","likes":"6","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/fort-mill-school-district-board-of-trustees-protect-parents-choice-in-fort-mill-school-district","author":"User60639","createdAt":"4 months ago","splitted":["And it takes a toll on ","children","’s mental ","health",", their social skills, and their confidence.

To say the least, I don't think SASD is taking this virus variant seriously. In a \" community where character counts\" not doing all you can to protect the health & safety of all is wrong. Frankly, if my daughter weren't a senior & didn't need classes you don't offer to online to graduate she would be staying home, especially, after the announcement of this mask optional policy in the height of a surge. I also recall the deadline to sign up for virtual academy was JUNE 18TH, when it couldn't be known how things were going to look now, a week away from the first day of school. To me, that doesn't sound like an administration with a keen understanding of how this virus is unpredictable & the need to be proactive as well as preventative. This draft plan also doesn't include specifics for ventilation mitigation, nor does take into account that Delta does not require \"close contact\" to spread. You notify an entire classroom of families for lice & not a deadly disease. You've made it painfully clear that you did not mandate the mask policy for transportation.  I believe, if given the opportunity, you wouldn't have created that policy. I made my mind up long ago that I would remove bussing from our calculus in returning to in-person learning.

However, we ask that the County Manager remove Dr. Comstock from her position as the Public Heath Director, and remove Public Health Order 21-002.  This will save our county the time, and money that will be required in defending an unjustified public health order.  As described in C.R.S, § 25-1-515, we parents, and our children of Jeffco have been aggrieved and affected by a decision of the board of health and its Director.  As described below, Dr. Comstock’s order is:\n 1)  Contrary to constitutional rights or privileges;\n 2)  Unsupported by substantial evidence in view of the entire record as submitted;\n3)  Arbitrary or capricious.\n\nAt no point during the last County Manager meeting, within the text of Public Health Order 21-002, or the August 17 meeting of Jeffco Public Health, did the board or Dr. Comstock present hospitalization data needed to justify the mandatory mask order.  Only case counts were presented.  However, if case counts rise, but hospitalizations and deaths of children do not - the order is arbitrary, and unsupported by substantial evidence. In fact, according to Colorado Covid Dashboard, there are 566 hospitalized people in CO total, with just 1.8% of hospitalizations being those under 19 years old.  Therefore, approximately 10 kids are currently hospitalized in all of Colorado.  While sad, it does not support masking children, or infringing on our parental rights considering there over 74,000 kids under 12 here in Jeffco alone.\n\nJeffco Public Health has performed research on the efficacy of face coverings, but its research is limited regarding the use of masks with 2 year old children.  Dr. Comstock repeatedly states in meetings that there are no studies that show mask use have a negative impact on children’s mental health, or ability to learn.  However, as it has been pointed out to Dr. Comstock, and was acknowledged by the Board of Health during the August 17th meeting, such a study would be unethical, and has not been performed. It would be unethical to place masks on a 2 year old, and no masks on another in order to study and watch for negative impacts to one child.s mental health or learning ability. \n\nIts research documented in https://www.jeffco.us/DocumentCenter/ from 2020 does not substantially suggest mask use of young children is a positive deterrent to contracting or sharing Covid-19.  In fact, the evidence recorded by the County often is contradictory regarding the efficacy of mask use overall.  It does not substantially suggest mask use of young children is a positive deterrent to contracting or sharing Covid-19. The public health board does not include the substantial amount of contradictory evidence into the public record. \n\nAlong the many issues described above, Dr. Comstock has repeatedly belittled, and spoken rudely in responses to concerned parents.  She has lost the public trust, and exhibited disrespectful behavior that is not becoming of a Jeffco County employee.  We seek her removal and cancelation of the mask mandate.  Please protect our rights as parents, and avoid a costly judicial review.","petitionSlug":"jefferson-county-colorado-request-for-the-resignation-of-dr-dawn-comstock","origin":"nomask","likes":"6","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/jefferson-county-colorado-request-for-the-resignation-of-dr-dawn-comstock","author":"User99954","createdAt":"4 months ago","splitted":["In accordance with Colorado Revised Statues, § 25-1-515, the parents of Jefferson County (Jeffco) have been aggrieved by the latest ","public"," ","health"," order, and are entitled to judicial review by filing in Jeffco district court a request to reverse or modify the ","public"," ","health"," order.

That's a CRAZY consent form to ask for, and I would NEVER subject my children to THAT kind of Physical and Mental ABUSE by his school officials, his own teachers, and school staff, that he is SUPPOSED to be able to trust!!\nBut NONE of this is following any science, they're letting the \"vaccinated\" kids stay in school, even if they're exposed, even though transmission by vaccinated people has been PROVEN at this point, and they should be treated just like any other student.\nThe school districts are BULLYING the parents into signing these forms, or they won't let their kids come to school. And they're fine with it. I was told that if I don't sign the consent form I can expect a LOT MORE of these \"modified quarantines\" with ZERO concern for my son's situation, for our situation, our work situations, none of it!! All of it is very SUDDEN when he's supposed to stay home, and I miss work, and he misses class time,  interaction with his friends, group activities with classmates, & perfectly healthy school time.\nThis WHOLE pandemic 400 people under the age of 18 have died. That is in about 20 months. In comparison 798 people under 18 died of \"unintentional drowning\" in 2019, 12 months. NOT that those lives didn't matter, but it's not an escalated number. Kids are NOT overly sensitive to this, and we should not be treating them as if they are. \nI'm sick of my son's school trying to act like a medical facility, and I would like them to go back to being able to see smiles on faces and talk to their friends. To not be medically tested for ANYTHING at all, ever, by the school - because that's not their job, & i'd like to see ACTUAL school subjects actually taught in school, rather than ideologies.\nWould love to meet some of the other ppl who signed!!

However, if they were study subjects then the vaccine trial (because let’s face it- that is what it is) would be wholly voluntary and without consequences if refused.  Since there is ZERO longitudinal data on safety, efficacy, long term side effects, etc., it is absolutely egregious that any RN or front line health provider should be coerced into having it injected into their body.  This also makes it IMPOSSIBLE for the recipient to be able to make an informed decision because there is woefully insufficient data.  Scientists do not even know when a booster is due, or how many.  The playbook is being written on the fly- THIS IS NOT SCIENCE!  So far the recommendation is now 3 vaccines in the span in one year-none of them prevent variants, nor do they prevent the vaccinated from carrying and spreading the virus to others.  So how exactly will vaccinating RNs protect patients?  It WON’T.  Providing accessible and quality PPE will, as it has been doing.   RNs are entitled to the right to self determination.

Cancer patients on chemo have always worn masks in public - they didn't require it of the rest of humanity. It's inhumane to force students to cover their faces, to wear bacteria-ridden masks all day long, to continuously breathe their own carbon dioxide back in.

As an AP / Honor student who is at higher risk of COVID-19. I'm disappointed to hear that I would be having to put my health at risk to get an education. I am a student who suffers from asthma and other pre-existing health conditions. Having myself to be going to school while covid-19 has taken a total of 941 confirmed cases and 17 deaths in Wilson County with numbers increasing will be putting my health, my family's health, the students’ health, the teachers’ health, the staff’s health, and overall everyone's health at risk. By making me have to go to school to get a college credit that I am planning on working hard to earn lacks consideration to people like me, vulnerable to getting COVID-19. The CDC ( Centers for Disease Control ) informed, “Everyone is at risk for getting COVID-19 if they are exposed to the virus. Some people are more likely than others to become severely ill, which means that they may require hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help them breathe, or they may even die.”  This is an extremely bad thing especially for a nation that lacks free healthcare for all. This being said, having AP/Honor students to be going to school to get college credit that they work incredibly hard for may cause catastrophic harm for the students and the people around them. Everyone can be affected if exposed, and I'm one that is not willing to take that risk. I know there are guidelines to stay safe such as washing hands and staying 6 ft apart, but in a school like Watertown High School, that might just be nearly impossible to stay 6 feet apart. The hallways, classrooms, and cafeteria are all easy ways to transfer covid-19, not to mention bathrooms. I don't know about you, but I have seen countless people go to the bathroom and not wash their hands. Having people with underlying medical conditions to go to school is discrimination against people who have immune systems that they cannot control. This is ableist, and shows how far your empathy extends. These are human lives at risk. Kids. The United States of America currently has 2,886,267 confirmed cases and 129,811 total deaths, and these cases keep growing especially with the economy opening back up. I hope we can find another solution to this problem because we as a whole are not doing enough.\n\nMandy Jones","petitionSlug":"donna-wright-make-wilson-county-schools-mandate-face-masks-for-7-12-graders","origin":"promask","likes":"2","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/donna-wright-make-wilson-county-schools-mandate-face-masks-for-7-12-graders","author":"User85768","createdAt":"a year ago","splitted":["Some ","people"," are more likely than others to become severely ill, which means that they may require hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help them breathe, or they may even die.”  This is an extremely bad thing especially for a nation that lacks free healthcare for all."],"id":"470913a1-e363-5236-a6c0-9332968650fb","commentableId":"23324206"},{"word":"others","comment":"The lives of others outweigh anyone's mild discomfort","petitionSlug":"porter-county-we-need-a-mask-mandate","origin":"promask","likes":"2","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/porter-county-we-need-a-mask-mandate","author":"User15858","createdAt":"a year ago","splitted":["The lives of others outweigh anyone's mild discomfort"],"id":"f251d580-6f52-5d2e-be5c-b7c93b1e4d97","commentableId":"23475033"},{"word":"others","comment":"It's important to wear a mask to help protect ourselves and others.","petitionSlug":"fcboe-set-a-mask-requirement-at-fayette-county-schools","origin":"promask","likes":"2","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/fcboe-set-a-mask-requirement-at-fayette-county-schools","author":"User19519","createdAt":"a year ago","splitted":["It's important to wear a mask to help protect ourselves and others."],"id":"e420303b-eb95-5498-a6d7-8c97830667c6","commentableId":"23364647"},{"word":"others","comment":"I care about others.","petitionSlug":"milwaukee-should-require-masks-in-public-places-to-protect-residents","origin":"promask","likes":"2","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/milwaukee-should-require-masks-in-public-places-to-protect-residents","author":"User63246","createdAt":"a year ago","splitted":["I care about others."],"id":"558048ef-1f59-5344-86d9-c619700adf07","commentableId":"22976515"},{"word":"others","comment":"My son is 6 and unable to get the vaccine.

While I cannot speak for everyone, I think there are a vast majority of us who pay the tuition and send our children to private schools not only for the incredible opportunities for our children to learn grow in their faith and spirituality, but also for our children to be able to learn and grown in an environment that fosters creativity, individuality, and the ability to think and do for themselves. It would be wonderful if the diocese could do the same for parents and allow us the ability to think and decide for ourselves whether or not our children wear masks.","petitionSlug":"diocese-of-evansville-catholic-schools-administrative-staff-make-masking-in-schools-an-individual-choice","origin":"nomask","likes":"8","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/diocese-of-evansville-catholic-schools-administrative-staff-make-masking-in-schools-an-individual-choice","author":"User39734","createdAt":"4 months ago","splitted":["For those parents who might still be unsure, the information is out there, it is plentiful, and it is easily and readily available for them to make informed decisions on their own as to the risks versus rewards of masks.

I agree as much as anybody else that we should have local control over mask mandates.\n\nI have three children in the district and I would like nothing more than to be able to tell them that I could fix this. I wish I could.\n\nI would also like to try to correct some misunderstandings in the community. I speak only for myself and do not speak for the board.\n\n#1: The school board has no control over masking decisions at this time. The governor has usurped our local control and has taken it out of our hands. If we had the authority to unmask the children I have no doubt that is the action we would take. We passed a unanimous resolution and sent a letter to the governor requesting local authority regarding masks and our desire to let our kids go back to school unmasked.\n\nIt may seem like the school board can do something about this situation, but we simply can't. Our hands our tied. But, we stand together with all of those that want to unmask our children.\n\nA better target is the governor. A petition to the governor, letters to the governor, and protests against the governor's decisions would be more appropriate.\n\nYou don't need to convince the school board, we already agree with you.\n\n#2: There's a belief by some people that we school board members serve on this board as our job and that we are willingly in cahoots with the governor because we want to protect the money that we receive personally for serving on the board. The fact is that we all receive $400 per month for our time. This is far from a job, it's community service. Every member of the board has another full-time job or is retired after a full career. The talk regarding money is actually that 99% of our funding comes from the state government. The state has threatened to withhold our funding if the mask mandate is not enforced. What this means is that the 900+ employees of the district, your neighbors and friends, would not be getting a paycheck, the schools would be closed and little kids would be stuck with nowhere to go during the day while their parents go to work.\n\n#3 There's a belief by some that the superintendent, Keith Lewis, could change these rules. It's even been suggested that if he doesn't \"stand up to the governor\" that he should resign. This is nonsense. Mr. Lewis has been nothing but proactive and a leader in the behinds-the-scenes interactions between local (especially rural) districts and the governor.

It is not the school district’s job or place to decide what is right for our children. Our children should not have a choice taken away from them of whether or not they will wear a mask, they should not be forced but given the option by parents who know and love their children far better than any school board. We should have rights to decide if we choose not to mask our children. Covid-19 is here, we can’t think it will magically disappear if we all wear masks. By instating lock downs, other restrictions, forcing people to wear masks against their own will, we are causing hurt and harm to those who did nothing wrong. This is a fight against having freedom to do what we feel is in the best interest for our health and our families health. The restrictions are destroying our economy, our countries small businesses, leading to a spike in suicide and a decrease in mental health. We are creating a far bigger plague that is effecting more than just those with COVID-19. Everyone has been in one way or another affected and we are creating new problems, and we are doing far greater harm than good. A mask restriction may seem a small thing but it is a sign of our freedoms being taken from us- a government telling us that we can’t make good decisions for ourselves and our families. This country stands for freedom, freedom to make a choice of what we feel is right. There is no “right” or “wrong” here. If we keep placing such hard restrictions we hurt the innocent, destroy business, and are fueling pain and mental illness, and may continue to loose innocent people to suicide. People will continue to loose their jobs, their homes, their livelihoods and the economy will continue to spiral and the federal government will go into perpetual debt. If we lift restrictions there is a chance we may loose more lives to COVID-19, however those who are high risk can choose to protect themselves, take extra precautions, and choose to be vaccinated. That’s really what it comes down to is choice. We should be given the choice to own up to our personal decisions of what we feel to be right and not allow the government, school boards, or anyone to take those choices away from us and then we must individually and collectively own up to the consequences (knowing there will be consequences regardless of the choice) and do our very best to gain control of the situation. Do not tell me what is best for my child or me without giving me a choice.

There has been way too much unscrupulous activity since this whole \"corona virus pandemic\" started.  There have been many doctors that have come out and questioned the so called science that the cdc claims they are going by only to be censored for speaking about the facts that they have learned through many years of schooling themselves.  Not to mention Dr. Birx herself,  one of the leaders of the covid19 response admitted on live tv that anyone that died that had covid, no matter what they died of was counted as a covid death.  That statement itself should have woken people up to the reality that something nefarious was going on.  And also the facts were shown that the vast majority of people who were at risk of dying of covid 19 were the elderly and people who already had underlying conditions.  These people were the same people that were at risk of dying from any other illness.  And suddenly there were virtually no flu cases last year, deaths by heart attacks, strokes, cancer and virtually all other deaths were way down.  Could it be that this was because all these deaths were counted as covid deaths?  I think so!  So I'm signing this petition because it's time to unmask our children and all the citizens in our country and get back to breathing clean, fresh air.","petitionSlug":"broward-county-school-board-time-to-end-the-maskerade","origin":"promask","likes":"1","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/broward-county-school-board-time-to-end-the-maskerade","author":"User27098","createdAt":"7 months ago","splitted":["I'm signing this petition because we have a corrupt government that is trying to take away our ","rights","."],"id":"3f457324-8aa8-5810-a05c-7ba4af553651","commentableId":"28719921"},{"word":"rights","comment":"There are reasonable studies that show that masks on everyone in public are our best hope for keeping COVID19 under control.

Your rights bump into my rights and so they stop there. It’s reasonable. Be calm and put your mask on. We shouldn’t be socializing much anyway.

Source: your local epidemiologist. \n\nThere’s no lack of anecdotal evidence that pediatric hospitals are reaching capacity in many states. \nIn the past week, 121,427 kids tested positive for COVID19, which represented 18% of the weekly reported cases in the United States. This is increasing at an exponential rate, but adult cases are also increasing exponentially.\n\nIn 23 states, 1.9% of child COVID-19 cases resulted in hospitalization. Last Saturday, 1,902 kids were hospitalized for COVID19. The CDC has also made MIS-C (serious condition associated with COVID-19) data publicly available. As of July 31, 4,404 kids were diagnosed with MIS-C associated with COVID19 in the United States.\n\nWe are very lucky that kids aren’t as high of risk for severe disease as older adults. But, even given this, I’m still concerned about three things…\n\n***First, the rate in which hospitalizations are increasing.*** We are far beyond the January peak, which is particularly apparent in the South (second graph). This could be due to pandemic fatigue (we just don’t care anymore). Or this could be due to Delta being more serious than previous variants. There is preliminary evidence from Scotland and Canada that adult hospitalization is more severe with Delta. We have yet to see kid data, but I don’t have reason to believe that it’s different.\n\n***Second, pediatric ICU (PICU) capacity.*** We desperately need to flatten the pediatric hospital curve. Only ~38% of kids have “natural” immunity and the majority of kids aren’t eligible for vaccines, which means we have an estimated 34 million susceptible children in the United States. If 1.9% of infected children are hospitalized, 33% of the kids go to the PICU, and the average hospital stay is 4 days, that means we need 6,800 PICU beds. The U.S. only has 4,500 PICU beds total. (If you want to check the math, go to this amazing thread by Dr. Denise Dewald).\n\nWe could easily overwhelm our pediatric hospitals. And this is just with COVID19. RSV is also at an all time high. Car accidents and drownings, for example, are also still happening in the background. We can’t just put kids in adult hospital beds. Kids aren’t tiny adults, they need special equipment, correct dosages, and trained hospital staff (who are getting more and more difficult to find because they are burned out). We also can’t just systematically fly children from Texas (where hospitals are full) to Maryland (where hospitals aren’t full).\n\nWhat schools do (or do not do) will impact case growth and, thus, impact how our hospitals fare too. A group of scientists in North Carolina modeled what may happen across schools that implement masks and/or surveillance testing. Without masks or regular testing, up to 90% of susceptible students may become infected by the end of the semester. \n\n***Third, kids’ role in the transmission chain.*** Yesterday, an important study was published in JAMA. Scientists sought out to answer how kids of all ages transit COVID19 in Canadian households from June 1 and December 31, 2020. They studied both the index cases and the rate of transmission in the household.","petitionSlug":"residents-of-middletown-nj-middletown-masks","origin":"promask","likes":"3","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/residents-of-middletown-nj-middletown-masks","author":"User50666","createdAt":"4 months ago","splitted":["We are very lucky that kids aren’t as high of ","risk"," for severe disease as older adults."],"id":"5e0b714b-9da0-5d37-bb88-fc22f474eed4","commentableId":"30421601"},{"word":"risk","comment":"Not wearing a mask has been proven to spread covid.

When I asked her if it was weird that everyone was wearing masked she said, no not AT ALL. This rule was the only reason my mother (who has always had asthma and is in her late 50s) let my sister go back to physical school at all. If there is not a mask mandate, then there might be parents who are at risk like her who won’t let there kids go to school who then will subsequently receive a lower quality of education. If you require students to buy non-ripped jeans then you can require kids to buy a 1$ mask and wear it.","petitionSlug":"bartow-county-school-system-require-bartow-county-students-and-staff-to-wear-masks-when-on-campus","origin":"promask","likes":"3","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/bartow-county-school-system-require-bartow-county-students-and-staff-to-wear-masks-when-on-campus","author":"User25802","createdAt":"a year ago","splitted":["If there is not a mask ","mandate",", then there might be parents who are at ","risk"," like her who won’t let there kids go to ","school"," who then will subsequently receive a lower quality of education."],"id":"437b7c30-3a0f-53f4-9e6e-693e0f62005f","commentableId":"23962559"},{"word":"risk","comment":"All children in CCISD deserve to be educated in a equally healthy and safe environment.

If parents aren’t wanting their children to wear masks, it seems to be a safe assumption that some of these parents aren’t vaccinated, thus increasing the likelihood that their children will have increased exposure. My child shouldn’t have to pay the price for another adults poor judgment. Our kids deserve a chance to maintain their health and safety even if some  parents aren’t willing to fight for it. The kids did a great job with their masks last year, and as a result, our Elkhorn students and families had a great layer of prevention.

There are precautions that can be put in place to create a more interactive learning environment. The risk of the spread of Covid-19 is not the only risk to consider, nor is it the most important. I appreciate that these are difficult decisions, but it is imperative to to change the current environment at UVA. \nFinally, it grieves me that these students feel that they must protest anonymously!

I’ve read a tremendous amount of data, studies & listened to doctors, virologists, & immunologists on either side of this & while I am nothing more than a lay person on the street, I try to be as logical as I can about this & all matters regarding covid & my own personal well being.  I have grave concerns about the dangers of masks themselves & the harm they can do.  When reading comments & hearing conversations where it’s been said “it’s only a mask; what could it hurt?”  The people who are saying this couldn’t have invested the time to learn all they can about the dangers of masks.  I have spent many hours & days studying information & there is nothing that has been  proven to show that masks are beneficial in reducing the spread of this virus or any sickness.  My only regret is I wish I had saved the CDCs own study about masks that was posted on their website in mid to late summer 2020, but was removed a few days afterwards.  Masks harbor germs & are germ infested once the first breath is taken through one.  I am unable to wear a mask due to personal reasons, but even if I could, I believe I would have to decline doing so for other health reasons.  I suffer from two chronic immune system diseases, so I am not in a position to take that kind of a chance.  Children & their health & well being which includes their mental state are the focus of this petition & I agree the mandatory decision made by some of the school board members is not the best decision.  Parents should be the ones making the decision about their own children.  Parents know their children’s medical conditions & their day to day well being.  I believe the parents that say their children were suffering from wearing masks.

Notification of not being able to wear the mask due to health reasons should be provided by a person's healthcare provider. The policy suggestion of allowing a parent, guardian, possibly a student, write a letter to be excused from wearing a mask should not be passed. Verification should come from a healthcare provider, who has the training and credentials to make a recommendation that not only affects their patient, but the people around them. We don't accept a parent's word for it that their child is well enough to participate in sports, for example, but require a medical clearance. During a public health crisis, medical personnel are the appropriate people to verify this.

As a healthcare professional, I put stock in the recommendations for the American Pediatric Academy, and their recommendations that any child over the age of 2 - regardless of vaccination status - should be masked while inside.

On Thursday, the 2nd day of school, I was notified of a positive COVID case within my child's class. 3 of 24 children are masked and the teacher will not remind masked children to wear properly. I have offered to purchase wipes and Lysol spray. That has not been acted upon. If CISD is not putting into place other protective measures (e.g. using misters, wiping and cleaning classrooms, hand sanitizer, air filtration systems) in at least elementary the easiest thing to do is a mask mandate.  As a mother I am wrestling with the virtual program option that seems punitive in substance for those children who may participate. My child has already been to class and if is pulled will be reshuffled in a different class in Jan. I feel that is cruel as well. She should be able to return to the class where she has made a relationship.  Parents trust that the Central Office and Administration will protect our children.

It's been well-established by medical experts that, with this particular virus, wearing masks is one of the absolute most important and effective things we can do to protect EVERYONE. To knowingly ignore this is negligent and reprehensible. That said, it only works if we ALL (with the exception of those with valid health issues) take responsibility and wear them CONSISTENTLY.  It must be mandated in order to work.\n\nUnfortunately, \"Strongly recommending\" or \"Strongly encouraging\" simply won't suffice. That type of verbiage will not be enough and we all know this. Peer pressure amongst students (\"he's not wearing one, so neither will I\") will quickly cause decreasing numbers of mask-wearers by the day. \n\nWhile I personally do not feel that elementary-age children wearing masks ALL DAY (through 7 hours of instruction, inside their \"family modell\" classroom) is feasible or prudent , I do, however, feel very strongly that in order to strike a compromise while still best protecting our children AND our teachers, bus drivers, and other adult staff (who are indispensable and far more vulnerable), masks should be MANDATORY in FOUR key areas/times: \n 1. Buses 2. Hallways/Common Areas 3. Arrival and 4. Dismissal.  \nMandating masks in these locations and situations makes complete sense given the much larger groups and wider exposure, which is inevitable and very concerning.  \n\nThis is not asking too much of our children. They CAN do this. But they need adults (*parents and *administrators) to set an example. If there's anything we need to TEACH our children, it's that we must care for one another and do what's necessary to get this under control. By mandating masks during key areas and times, we can protect everyone and decrease the spread. \n\nIf other schools and states can do this, SO CAN WE. Sadly, our state has failed miserably to slow the spread of COVID-19.  Our numbers are abysmal and terrifying- among the highest in the WORLD. We have to stand up and do what is right. To do WHAT WORKS to contain the virus. Fort Mill School District's motto is \"Children First...Every Day.\"  Our district needs to DEMONSTRATE this. We MUST protect our children's health and safety, more than anything else. \n\nEnforcing a MASK *RULE will do just that. It will save lives...of both teachers and students (as well as families, friends, and others in our beloved community). To do anything less is beyond careless and is guaranteed to result in far more absences, quarantines, shut downs, teacher loss, and tragedies.","petitionSlug":"fort-mill-school-district-administration-board-of-trustees-mandate-masks-in-the-fort-mill-school-district","origin":"promask","likes":"1","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/fort-mill-school-district-administration-board-of-trustees-mandate-masks-in-the-fort-mill-school-district","author":"User59344","createdAt":"a year ago","splitted":["Unfortunately, \"Strongly recommending\" or \"Strongly encouraging\" simply won't suffice.

Parent/Alum here...When I was in college in the early 90’s, the classroom was a place for robust exchanges of ideas, of respectful, albeit at times heated, discussions. We were there to learn, to educate ourselves and to be educated. As it stands now, my child is not receiving an education, they’re receiving an indoctrination and that is unacceptable and frightening. If a teacher wants to share with the class that “we deserved 9/11,” then that teacher needs to be prepared to discuss their viewpoint, as well of those of the class. Calling a student who disagrees and that, no, we did not “deserve” it, a “white privileged nazi” is NOT a healthy (or frankly, rational) discussion.  Viewpoints and opinions are one thing, ideologies are a very different, very dangerous, other thing. Take Greek life for example. Spend 5 minutes on Twitter, and you will find out how many teachers “feel” about the subject. It’s incredibly disconcerting. Students are targeted, belittled, and judged as being part of a “racist, classist, patriarchal system that must be destroyed.” What is progressive or compassionate about such inflammatory statements? Statements coming from those in leadership, no less. Why is UVA enabling the vitriol? For all the recent talk of “safe spaces,” doesn’t every student have the right to feel safe? Stop indulging the cancel culture festering on campus. Lastly, and most importantly, the Covid protocols in place are, and have been, detrimental (understatement) to the students’ mental and physical well being. What part of isolating a child off campus for 14 days, unable to leave for fresh air or exercise, and only a box of food the wouldn’t meet federal govt standards...a low bar to begin with...appropriate?Yet, that is what you all did, until enough pushback gave you the equally inhumane idea of locking down dorms with threats of expulsion should they disobey orders. To make matters worse, you openly encouraged students to report any (perceived) deviation from the weekly Covid edicts. As if there was no room for error in that grand plan. How many students were falsely reported, I wonder.  What proof did you require to ensure these “reports” weren’t simply targeted harassment? Did you advance your mission of a “community bound by trust, respect, and integrity” or is UVA now a community bound by paranoia and fear? Quite the unintended, at least I hope it was, psyop UVA created. If the goal was to break their spirits in order to achieve full submission, congratulations, it worked. I entrusted my child with you all knowing full well there would be rules and expectations. At NO time did it ever occur to me that they would be subjected to the stripping away of basic human rights, and kindness. The bond of trust, the respect I once had, is now gone. My hope is that it can be rebuilt, but given there was a need for this petition, I’m not particularly optimistic. The saddest part about what students have been subjected to this year, is that my child has the means to “escape.” Others don’t have that luxury. It’s heartbreaking when I think about the worry, helplessness, and anger their parents feel. This is not hyperbole. This is based on real conversations with parents anguished over their once “happy go lucky” child. If teachers/leadership spent half the time and energy they spend on Twitter raging and complaining, and, instead, focused on THE STUDENTS, these young people might regain a sense of hope and trust. Students need help now.  Figure it out UVA. It can be done, and it can be done in a safe, actual data, science driven manner. Until then, UVA is failing our young people. The adults in leadership are failing our young people. We adults owe them the same opportunities we had. Time to recenter on our young people.","petitionSlug":"the-univeristy-of-virginia-administration-uva-students-requesting-the-support-of-alumni-and-parents","origin":"nomask","likes":"2","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/the-univeristy-of-virginia-administration-uva-students-requesting-the-support-of-alumni-and-parents","author":"User62039","createdAt":"9 months ago","splitted":["Viewpoints and opinions are one thing, ideologies are a very different, very dangerous, other thing."],"id":"ee6b3947-a9b9-5105-9f76-f5183c211b26","commentableId":"27866933"},{"word":"thing","comment":"Because it is the right thing to do!

These schools now mandate masking and have proper mitigation practices, but only after hundreds of students fell ill and many more were quarantined.   Why does school leadership take the lives of our children and their staff so lightly?  There are currently better mitigation practices for head lice than there are for covid at CCISD.  Physicians, the CDC, AAP and epidemiologists all agree that masking, proper isolation/quarantine, vaccination and social distancing are ALL necessary in surge areas, which we clearly are.  Children under 12 cannot get the vaccine and our overall vaccination for even older kids is very low.  There are currently no pediatric ICU beds open in this area—where will we send kids who get sick as they will get sick since delta covid is as contagious as chicken pox and has almost 3x higher risk for pediatric hospitalization as compared to earlier strains?  There are federal funds for schools to implement online learning—why is this not happening?  This pandemic is real and worse than last year when students were actually masked and had online options.  If nothing can be done, then CCISD really needs to consider delaying school opening several weeks until this surge improves.  Hospitals is this area are already beyond capacity—the community has every right to blame the school leadership for poor outcomes from school related infections if schools have no real preventive practices in place.  Please do what is right for the health of our kids and community—this is not a matter of politics or preference.","petitionSlug":"clear-creek-isd-mandate-masks-in-clear-creek-isd","origin":"promask","likes":"2","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/clear-creek-isd-mandate-masks-in-clear-creek-isd","author":"User90312","createdAt":"4 months ago","splitted":["","Children"," under 12 cannot get the ","vaccine"," and our overall vaccination for even older kids is very low."],"id":"29a0d487-87fc-57c2-86ba-e2d6935cf3b0","commentableId":"30325071"},{"word":"vaccine","comment":"My vaccinated senior child wants to have the best senior year and is will a bit of discomfort to to this.

There is ZERO proof of mask efficacy (in fact, to the contrary-several significant sources if peer-reviewed studies show the dangers!) in anyone when utilizing cloth or surgical masks. Did you know that specific architecture and engineering is required within health and medical facilities that enable health care workers and patients to wear certain masks safely and effectively? Are our schools ventilation systems regulated and engineered in this way? I’ll answer that: NO, they absolutely are not. It is dangerous and hazardous to the health of anyone wearing these types of masks for extended periods of time within settings other than those designed for mask use in this manner. Furthermore, it does nothing to stop viruses from moving through the air. Now, stop the political charade snd stop the attempts to force masks on our children! The MDHHS also has ZERO authority to “mandate” or create ANY type of requirements by LAW. Legislature never approved any of this. Hence it is null and void as far as enforcement. Their job is solely to provide health assistance to the community, nothing more. \nDirectly from Michigan legislature: \nTHE REVISED SCHOOL CODE (EXCERPT)\nAct 451 of 1976\n\n\n380.1307b Statement of prohibited practices.\nSec. 1307b.\n\nThe state policy under section 1307a shall include a clear statement that all of the following practices are prohibited for school personnel in the public schools of this state under all circumstances, including emergency situations:\n(a) Corporal punishment, as defined in section 1312.\n(b) The deprivation of basic needs.\n(c) Child abuse.\n(d) Seclusion, other than emergency seclusion.\n(e) The intentional application of any noxious substance or stimulus that results in physical pain or extreme discomfort.

As adults you have to be the role model for students, this is a great time to show students that protecting each other and each other’s families is important.

The only way your spit would leave your mask is if you were to sneeze VERY harshly or switch gravity. As long as everyone practices good hygiene and wears a masks we shouldn’t lose anyone at this wonderful school (make it known to students not to touch their eyes as-well unless their hands have just been washed).

The FM ISD is a great system and this is a tough decision but as some have mentioned on here, if we can enforce dress codes then let’s do our part and require a piece of cotton to be worn until this country begins to put this pandemic behind us. \n\nThank you to all of those nurses, doctors and teachers who are willing to step up in these uncertain times to care for our sick and for our students.","petitionSlug":"fort-mill-school-district-administration-board-of-trustees-mandate-masks-in-the-fort-mill-school-district","origin":"promask","likes":"2","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/fort-mill-school-district-administration-board-of-trustees-mandate-masks-in-the-fort-mill-school-district","author":"User27546","createdAt":"a year ago","splitted":["We take it very serious and require all to be masked because we see\nmasks as a way to slow the ","spread","."],"id":"9cf28f27-23d6-5ab3-9e52-1349b469545c","commentableId":"23424501"},{"word":"way","comment":"WHO on December 2nd published a report that said masks “do very little to stop the spread of COVID” their advice continued that the best way to stop the spread is “wash hands regularly and do not touch your face” The false sense that masks actually work has caused more harm than good in preventing the spread of COVID.","petitionSlug":"greg-abbott-reinstate-the-texas-covid-19-mask-mandate","origin":"promask","likes":"2","petitionLink":"https://www.change.org/p/greg-abbott-reinstate-the-texas-covid-19-mask-mandate","author":"User56921","createdAt":"9 months ago","splitted":["WHO on December 2nd published a report that said masks “do very little to stop the ","spread"," of ","COVID","” their advice continued that the best way to stop the ","spread"," is “wash hands regularly and do not touch your face” The false sense that masks actually work has caused more harm than good in preventing the ","spread"," of ","COVID","."],"id":"99642ace-3414-5d5e-9fae-e0ada2dc82dc","commentableId":"27646393"},{"word":"way","comment":"Despite popular opinion here in Georgia, masks actually do help.
