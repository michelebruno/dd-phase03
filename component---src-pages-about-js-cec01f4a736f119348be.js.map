Starting from an analysis\n                    of\n                    the main petition themes across different countries, the focus of the research narrowed down to the\n                    images and language used on the platform.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    The aim of this website is to make the dataset used in this research available to researchers and\n                    potential activists interested in the subject. To do this, we set ourselves the objective of\n                    realising a\n                    tool to explore the language and arguments used in comments to petitions regarding the mask mandate\n                    in\n                    the United States.\n\n                </p>\n\n                <h2>Data</h2>\n                <p>\n                    Comments on change.org differ slightly from comments on other platforms. Only those who signed a\n                    petition can leave a comment on it, as the platform intends comments as \"reasons to sign\" and\n                    prompts\n                    users to explain why they signed right after they do so. This means there are no comments against a\n                    petition but only comments supporting it.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    When publishing a petition on change.org, users must add at least one tag to indicate its general\n                    subject. Tags differ from country to country, and the United States are the only country with tags\n                    both\n                    in favour and against the same issue: mask mandates.\n                    Finding this interesting, we decided to collect all the petitions that used these tags.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    The first step was compiling a list of all the tags related to mask mandates and group them\n                    according to\n                    their position: in favour or against.\n                </p>\n\n\n                <p>\n                    We then made a list of all the petitions presenting at least one of the tags above. Since there was\n                    no\n                    easy way to do this from the website, we wrote a script in python to do this for us.\n                    <br/>\n                    The script - commonly known as scraper - sends requests to change.org's server-side API, asking for\n                    all\n                    the petitions tagged with a specific tag. The server then answers back with a *.json file containing\n                    all\n                    the petitions we asked for - this includes the title, body, image, signature count, etc.\n                </p>\n\n\n                <p>\n                    We filtered the petitions, selecting only the 100 most signed in both groups. Once we had the\n                    petitions,\n                    we could use their ID to ask the API for their comments. Once again, the server answered back with a\n                    *.json file containing all the comments for each petition.\n                </p>\n\n\n                <p>\n                    Once all the comments were gathered, we used Google Natural Language API to extract entities from\n                    the\n                    dataset - these are words and idioms. This was a quick and easy way to get rid of punctuation,\n                    articles,\n                    conjunctions and verbs.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    At this point, we counted how many times each word appeared and converted the absolute number to\n                    percentage values for both groups.\n                </p>\n\n\n                <p>\n                    We then used these percentages to determine whether the word was used with the same frequency by\n                    both\n                    groups or if one used it more than the other. We used the following proportion to transform the two\n                    percentages into a single, more readable metric.\n                </p>\n\n\n                <h2>Interactions</h2>\n                <p>\n                    The user navigates the archive by the selection of keywords to use as filters. Once the archive is\n                    opened, the user can find the first-level filters in the left side column: these are the words used\n                    with\n                    the same frequency by both groups.\n                </p>\n                <p>Once the first word is selected, the central panel will display words related to the one that has\n                    just\n                    been selected. These words will be positioned horizontally according to their usage by either group\n                    and\n                    vertically according to the amount of time they appear together with the selected word.</p>\n\n                <p> The user can now select any word displayed on the central panel as a second-level filter. Once this\n                    is\n                    done, the user is presented with a list of comments where both keywords appear.</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    If the user does not want to use a second-level filter, comments can be accessed through the \"read\n                    comments\" button under the related words.</p>\n\n\n                <h2>Visual language</h2>\n                <p>The colour palette used in this website was chosen in such a way as to avoid any political\n                    affiliation with political parties, given the controversial nature of the issue in the United\n                    States. </p>\n                <p>\n                    The usage of a comment box in the introduction and the usage of pills to display words in the\n                    archive have been taken from change.org's user interface. The interaction dynamic has been kept the\n                    same while their aesthetic has been adapted to the rest of the website.\n                </p>\n                <p>We decided to use comments in the introduction to the website. This was done to emphasise the fact\n                    that a user can leave a comment only once they have signed the petition. Pills have been used to\n                    represent words in the archive to recall the usage of pills to represent topics in Change.org.</p>\n\n            </article>\n\n            <nav className={\"sticky top-24\"}>\n                <Button as={'button'}>\n                    FOCUS, AIM AND OBJECTIVE\n                </Button>\n            </nav>\n        </div>\n     </Layout>\n}"],"names":["About","wrapperClassName","container","footer","className","as"],"sourceRoot":""}
